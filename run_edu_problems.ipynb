      "Group A: Hi, today we will be working with this word problem, CeCe is making cookies with white and brown sugar. She puts two eighths cups of white sugar in the cookie dough, then she puts in the brown sugar. She has seven eighths cups of sugar and all how much brown sugar is in the recipe. So here we know that we have to eight cups of white sugar. The unknown is the amount of brown sugar. But we do know how much sugar is in all. So we would set up this word problem as seven eight cups of sugar minus two eight cups of white sugar equals the unknown amount of brown sugar. So we know that our denominators which is the bottom eight is the same so we are able to subtract easily. So here I've drawn one circle equals 1878 equals seven circles, and then two eighths equals two circles. So following our subtraction problem here, I would take away two of the circles from the seven eighths and that will leave us with five circles since one circle equals one eighths, five of the one eight equals five eighths. So we know that the five eighths is actually the amount of brown sugar in the recipe. We can also check our work by doing five eighths plus two eighths and we can add these easily since the denominator is the same. So the denominator would say the same as eight though it would not double. So if we do five plus two, we know that that is seven and we know that our answer is seven eighths. So we know two eighths cups of white sugar plus five eighths cups of brown sugar equals seven eighths cups of sugar and total. So there are ways to figure out when we get our answer with subtraction into addition, when the denominators are the same as well. So our answer to this word problem is there are five eighths cups of brown sugar in the cookie recipe\n",
      "Group A: Hi, everyone. So today we're going to look at a word problem and really think about what the word problem is asking us. And like what the context of the word problem is. So the word problem that we have today is Ava's mom is 28 years old. Her grandmother is 51 years old. How much older is Ava's grandma than her mom? So, we have Ava's mom is 28 years old. And then we have the grandma, which is 51 years old. So when we think about this word problem, we're thinking about trying to find the difference between the two ages. So in order to find the difference, we have to use subtraction. So we're going to take the biggest number 51, because that's the grandmas age minus Ava's mom's age of 28. And we're going to do some subtraction. So we the first one we have is one minus eight. And obviously, we can't do that. So we have to jump over to the five, cross the five out and we have to borrow 10. So we're going to cross the five out and make it a four. And we're going to move that right over here. Add 10 and make it 11. Now we have 11 minus eight, which is three. Then when we move over here, we have four minus two, which we know is two and we have the answer of 23. So this answer tells us that Ava's grandmother is 23 years older than Ava's mom\n",
      "Group A: already. So today I'm going to be showing you a think of a think aloud. Sorry, my bad, I think aloud is when a person says what they are thinking out loud. The think aloud strategy is incredibly helpful because we hear ourselves work through the problem, which helps us know each step we're taking. When we do it, think loud, because we can hear ourselves work through each step, we're more likely to catch our mistakes, helping us answer the question more accurately. So now I'm going to show you how I would do a think aloud and show you my thinking. So I think the first thing I would do is read the problem out loud. Diego and his cousin are sharing a pie together. Diego ate four tenths of the pie, his cousin eat some more. They ate nine tenths of the pie together. How much of the pie did his cousin eat? So now that I've read the problem, I think that I should talk about what I know about the problem. I know that Diego and his cousin are eating pie. I know that Diego ate four tenths of the pie. And I know that his cousin ate some of the pie. And I know all together Diego and his cousin ate nine tenths of the pie. So now that I've talked through everything I know, I'm gonna start thinking about what I don't know about the problem. I don't know how much pie his cousin ate. I do know that they ate nine tenths together. And I do know that Diego ate four tenths of the pie. But I don't know how much his cousin ate. Just show that I drew two different representations. I did a tape diagram. And I showed that I know that this box represents how much each of them ate. This box represents how much Diego ate Diego ate for this box represents how much his cousin ate? I don't know. So I did a question mark. And this box represents the total amount they ate. I showed the same relationship and a different format over here. I showed the total amount nine and I drew two lines to show that they are going into that answer of nine. I drew four, because that's how much Diego eight and I drew a question mark, because that's how much is cousin eight. Now that we've visually seen these quantities represented, I think that it's time that we solve the problem. As you can see, because we know our total, but we're missing one of the one number, we must be subtracting because they're trying to figure out how much of the pie they eat together. So because I know one way I could show this problem is nine equals four plus blank, because I can't do addition to solve this. I'm going to flip it around and do subtraction. Nine well I could do addition actually, but I'm gonna do subtraction, nine minus four equals five. And now I found my missing quantity for my addition problem. And yeah,\n",
      "Group A: For this problem we need to figure out how many mp3 player how much it would cost to buy mp3 players for all 18 classrooms. So we would need if each classroom gets an mp3 player we would need 18 mp3 players. So, to do this we can look at say that 98 To make it easier we could say $98 is about $100. So if we have 18 classrooms and $100 per mp3 player, we need to figure out how much it would cost for 18 mp3 players. So, one mp3 player is equal to 100. So we can just draw 18 of these and count out 100 for each one. So we could say 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800-900-1000 1100 with 1200 1300 1400 1500 1600 1700 1800. So 818 mp3 players would cost $1,800 or $1,800.\n",
      "Group A: Okay, for this think aloud, we're gonna figure out about how much would it cost to buy Np d player, or 18 classrooms in our school. So we have this table that we are going to follow along with. So the price of electronics we have our CD player is $74. The mp3 player is 98. So we're just, we're just gonna focus on that, we're just gonna focus on the mp3 player. So the mp3 player is $90. So that will be the price of US buying just one, just one. So if just one mp3 player is $90, we need 18 adults. So if we have we can't we can't add it because we're not doing that we're doing multiplication for this one. Because we want to figure out how many times do we need to buy an mp3? How many how many times we need to buy mp3 player? And how much would that cost? So yeah, 18 times nanny dollars, which during the math will be 1764. Because we need to buy this mp3 player for all of our classrooms, which there's 18 So we need to buy 18 times. So that will be $90 Each so each time so the costs of it to buy for all 18 classrooms for being 1764. And we figure this out because when you look at the table, each of these prices are just for one. So we have to make sure that we multiply it to get it to the amount we need. For our 18 classes we're looking for the cost\n",
      "Group A: Hi, everyone. So today we're going to be looking at a word problem. So the word problem is, there were 26 students in the cafeteria, there were 42 students on the playground, how many more students were on the playground than in the cafeteria. So to start with this problem, we're going to try to unpack it a little bit and look at like the really important stuff that was talked about. So what I first noticed, one of the important things, I think, is that there's two locations for the students, right? There's the cafeteria, and there's the playground. So I'm going to write down cafeteria, and playground. And you can just underline in, in the word problem where these are. And I think another really important part of this word problem would probably be who this is exactly about, right? So this word problem is talking about the students. Because the only people that are mentioned in this problem are students. I think we also probably should look at what the question is, so that we know what we're trying to find in this word problem. So I see the question is, how many more students were on the playground than in the cafeteria? So for this question, this is going to help us start thinking about if we're going to use addition, subtraction, multiplication, anything like that. And next, we're going to want to look at the quantities. So I see that there are two quantities, because one of these mean numbers, right? So the first quantity I see is 26 students. So I'm gonna write that down 26 students. And this is referring to students in the cafeteria, so we can even write in the cafeteria. So that we know there were 26 students in the cafeteria. And that's one of our really important quantities. And the second quantity that I see is 42 students, so we can write 42 students. And these students were on the playground. So we can write down 42 students on the playground. And the final thing that I can think of that I find really, really important, is like what we talked about before what we're going to solve but what number what are how, how this quantity would be displayed. So like would it be 26 cafeterias, 26 dogs or 26 students? So for our case, we would be looking for how many students right how many more students were on the playground and then cafeteria so our answer will be blank students. So then we know like the unit of what our answer will be\n",
      "Group A: All right, so today's problem is Diego and his cousin are sharing a pie. Diego eight four tenths of the pie. Is cousin ate some more to they ate nine tenths of the pie together. How much of the pie did his cousin eat? So we're going to try to figure out this word problem together to break down the context. First, you want to think about who's in the problem what's going on. So I know that there's someone named Diego. There's his cousin. And there is a pie. So I've drawn out a pie or Don Diego and a cousin. Moving on to the quality and quantities, I know that the pie was split into tenths. Diego ate four tenths of the pie. His cousin ate a unknown number of the pie. I'm gonna put a question mark an all together the nine tenths of the pie. So I do the pine tenths because they're saying nine tenths was eaten Diego 814. So we can assume that the cousin ate some sort of tenths, some amount of tenths of the pie, so I can put a question mark 10 and under number of tents, so what I can do is shade I'm gonna to shade in 1/10 of the pie. Because I know that wasn't eaten. Okay, there, we're down to the nine tenths of the pie with that shaded part. From there, I know that Diego 8/4 hands. So I'm going to mark in the pie, a little D in four of those tests. So if I know Diego at four pieces, and there was one piece that wasn't eaten, we can assume that these remaining pieces were eaten by the cousin. So 12345 So five pieces were eaten by the cousin or five tests, five pieces of size 1/10\n",
      "Group A: All right. So today I'm gonna be modeling. This probably guy, it's kind of showing you how I'm gonna go through it how I would do it with the intent of if you have a similar problem, you can do the same method or even just with this problem, you can vote with your own method, but I'm going to show you how I would go about thinking about it. So the problem is, by how much would it cost to buy mp3 players for all 18 classrooms in your school? Use the table to answer the question. So I know I'm looking for mp3 players, because that's what it says I know I have 18 classrooms. So I'm gonna find the mp3 players who are say costs, which is $98. And I know that for 18 classrooms, I need 18 mp3 clips. So because of this, I can do 98 times 18 Because I need 18 mp3 players that cost $90. So I don't really like the standard for this one. So I'm going to do the 98 times 10 To break it up a little easier, and the eight times 10 is 980. And I'm going to do 98 times I'm going to do two and then I'm going to do that four times that eight times too many times too many times too many times to four times. So I can do 98 times two pretty easily in my head just 196 So I know I have four copies of 196 now what I can do is I can add that to my first number which was 98 so I'm just gonna typically standardly add those up 612 1824 1018 Eight, seven baldies? So during that I got 1764 or 1764 So, if I need 18 mp3 players that costs money dollars I'm going to be spending 1764 Now, how might I do that with a picture you may be asking well that's a really good question um I would start With have a minute left sorry I'm reading out my diagram folly about how I'd set this up. Do but there are 10 of these 98 to represent the 98 times 10 that I started with. And then these ones are grouped into twos. So there's 9898 grouped into 298 any grouping to you\n",
      "Group A: Okay, everyone. So the problem that we're now going to be working with is finding out how much it would cost to buy an mp3 player for eight team classrooms using this chart. So as we can see an mp3 player cost $98, we want to find out how much it would cost to get that $98.18 times. So in other words, we are paying $98.18 times, which is 98 times 18. It's that $98 for the mp3 player, pay it 18 times. So 98 times eight team. And we know how to do that because we're in fifth grade. So let's go get to it. So first, we set up our 98 times 18. We start with our bottom number in the ones place. So eight times eight is 64. So we're going to put our four down. You know what, let me show you guys how I do this. So we're setting up 98 times 18. Just like that, and we're going to start with our eight team. I'm sorry, with our eight from our eight team. So we know that eight times eight is 64. So we're going to put our four down and put our six up, like so. Now we know that eight times nine is 72. Plus the six that we had leftover from before is 78. So we put 78 down, and we know that we're going to have to add something to that. So we add the addition sign. And we're going to add a zero in the ones place since we are now working with the 10s place. So this is what you should have down. Now we're working with the one in our 10s place of 18. One times eight is eight. So we're going to put our eight down below. And we can put a zero above to show that we don't have to add anything. Additionally, that's going to look like that. Now we know that one times nine is nine. So we'll put our nine down. And now that we've done all of our multiplication, we now have to add 784 plus 980 to find out the total costs of our mp3 players. So doing simple addition, four plus zero is four. Eight plus eight is 16. So we will be putting our six down and our one above. One plus seven is eight. Eight plus nine is 17. So this is what our final problem should look like. So that represents that the total cost of our $98 mp3 player for 18 classrooms. So 18 times is the number $1,764. And then we have it that's how we solve that problem.\n",
      "Group A: All right, so today I'm gonna think aloud to show you how I would solve the problem. Diego and his cousin are sharing a pie. Diego ate four tenths of the pie. His cousin ate some more, they ate nine tenths of the pie together. How much of the pie did his cousin eat? Okay, so I started by drawing just a pie as 10 slices. So this is what the pie looks like, before anybody ate anything, just a pie cut into 10 pieces. So Diego ate four. So on this next pie, I'm going to shade in four slices, meaning Diego ate that many. Now what we know is that Diego and his cousin together ate nine of the 10 pieces. So I'm now going to shade in nine of these 10 pieces over here. So I have four out of 10. Nine out of 10. So if I look at the difference between this pie and this pie, and I count the difference. I did I had 1234. And then I'll count how many more it took to get to nine to see how many D goes cousin eight. So there's 412345. Now let's see if that's actually not 123456789. All right, so that means that Diego's cousin ate five of the 10 pieces. Four out of the 10 Plus five out of the 10 equals well, four plus five, nine. We have our denominator, nine out of 10\n",
      "Group A: Hello everyone. So today we will be talking about word problems. Where problem I have for us today is a this mom is 28 years old, her grandma is 51. How much older is Ava's grandma than her mom? The first thing we want to do is write down. What we do know from the problem the numbers that we do know. So we know that Ava's mom is 28. And if his grandma is 51, then the problem that we do want to find out is how much older Ava's grandma is than her mom. In other words, we want to find the difference between the ages of A plus grandma and Ava's mom. So when we hear the word difference, we automatically want to think subtraction. So we are going to be doing a subtraction problem to find out the difference in ages between the two women. Now when we're doing subtraction, we want to start with the bigger number on top, so that would be 51. Eight is grandma's age. So we want to do 51 minus 28, which is the age of a this mom. It'll look like this. And then we do what we've learned before with subtraction. We take the 10s place from the five that becomes a four we have now 11 minus eight, which is three and four minus two, which is two, and then we get 23. So Ava's grandma is 23 years older than Ava's mom.\n",
      "Group A: So to begin this problem, we're going to just read it out. So about how much would it cost to buy mp3 players for all 18 classrooms in your school. And on this, there's also a chart and it says, the price of the electronics and then it has CD players 74 mp3 players 98. Smart speaker is 199 and am FM radio is $29. So, for this problem, we are going to we know that it's multiplication because well actually, first we're going to underline all the important information. So we'll underline the mp3 players to and then 18 classrooms because you will be doing the price the mp3 player times the amount of classrooms. So with this information, we know that it would be 18 groups of $98. And then to go from there, we would probably round up to 20 groups of $90 just because that would be the easiest to solve, which would be 19 or sorry $1,960. And then again, from there, we would have to do we would have to take away two groups of the $98 which would be you would take away $196 Which would get you to $1,764\n",
      "Group A: Okay, class. So today I'm going to work through a math problem with you. So you can see how much thinking I do before I jump into solving the problem. Because when I jump into solving things, I don't pay attention to close details and what the problems actually asking me. So therefore I make errors. So the problem we're working with is there were 26 students in the cafeteria. There were 42 students on the playground, how many more students were on the playground and in the cafeteria. That's a lot of information. But I know that if I take my time, I can work through it, and I can solve it. So first, I think I should ask myself, what the problems actually about. I just read a lot. So let me think. So I know the problem is about students, their students in a cafeteria and there's also students on the playground, I like to go to the playground. So we have students in the cafeteria and students on the playground. Well, how many students do I have in the cafeteria? Let me reread. Oh, okay. So 26 students in the cafeteria. Okay. And then how many students child on the playground? Have you reread again? Okay, so 42 students on? Oh, there were 26 students in the cafeteria. And then there were 42 students on the playground. Okay, so 26 students in one place 42 students and other. Okay, so I know what the numbers mean. But what's the problem actually asking? It's asking me how many machines from the playground and in the cafeteria. Okay, so it's just asking me, there's more students on the playground, it's asking me how many more there are on the playground than in the cafeteria? Okay, well, I can make a drawing to help make thinking. So let me see 26 students in the cafeteria, spend more model. And then in a separate area, I'm gonna read 46 students. So by drilling the model, it kind of helps me visualize the problem. And I'll see solid easier. So I have 26 students in one area and 46 on the other. I want to know how many more on the playground I can think to myself, how much does it take to get from 26 to 46. So my problem may look like started 26. I need to figure out on number one how much it takes to get to 46 That's how I may solve it but I'm excited to see how you solve it.\n",
      "Group A: Okay, so the question we're going to start out with today is, CeCe is making cookies with white and brown sugar. She puts 2/8 cups of white sugar in the cookie dough. Then she puts in the brown sugar. She has seven, eight cups of sugar and all, how much brown sugar is in the recipe? So let's read that question again, how much brown sugar is in the recipe? So this, we're going to underline the question here. This is what we're solving for. We are solving to see how much brown sugar there is in this recipe. So let's go back and look at the numbers that it gives us. Let's look at the facts that it gives us. So it tells us right here, CeCe puts two eight cups of white sugar. So let's circle to eight cups of whichever. So we know that there's already two eight cups avoid sugar in the recipe, then she puts in the brown sugar. But it doesn't tell us how much brown sugar. But let's just say well, she puts in brown sugar. We don't know how much. So we're going to write a question mark. That's how we know that what we're solving for is how much brown sugar there is in the recipe. So let's find out. Let's write out a number model that might help us solve this problem. So let's start out with two eight cups. cup of white sugar. Plus, we don't know questionmark cup of brown sugar is equal to and it tells us right here, how much sugar we have in all so let's take all that too. She has seven eight cups of sugar and all. So that means with the white sugar and brown sugar combined. She has seven, eight cups. And Oh. All right, so here's our number model to eighth cup of white sugar plus unknown amount of brown sugar is equal to 7/8 cup of sugar in all, so let's write that without units now. So we're gonna have two eights plus unknown is equal to seven eighths. So how can we solve this now? How can we jump from two eighths to seven eighths? Maybe we want to make a number line for this. So for this number line, I'm going to start with what I already know, I already know that I have two eighths of white sugar. So I'm going to use white, W for White. And then I end that seven eighths How do I know seven if I go here, because this is how much sugar we have in all. So this is going to be a for all. So I want to see how much for around sugar she had for the recipe. So the spacing between the two eighths and seven eighths is going to give us how much brown sugar she used. Because she because we know if she has seven ace in total, and she already used to ace cups. Whatever she needs to add for two eighths to get to seven eighths is what would be the amount of bachelor sciatic. So luckily, we can tell that everything's already in eighth. So let's just keep adding apes until we can get to 70s. So here we're at two eighths, and let's add another eighth. So we want to jump, pull the last one eight. Now we're at three. Oh, not at seven Hmm, so let's add another one plus one eight. Now we're at four eight knots quite there yet. Let's add another eight. Now we're at five, it's not quite there yet. Let's add another eight plus one, eight. Now we're at six, eight. Still not there. But if we just have one more a, so plus one more eight. Now we're at 70s. Look at that. We made all these jumps. But what do we have to do now? We have to add up all of our jumps to see how many ace that was in total. So let's do that right here. We have 12345 we had five eighths, so this to get to 2/8 to seven eighths was really just adding five eighths. So this means that two eighths plus five A is equal to seven eight. And that means that five eighths is how much brown sugar we had\n",
      "Group A: All right class, how's everybody doing today? Wonderful. All right, we're gonna go ahead and get started on our word problem of the day. We've been talking a lot about place value lately, and about combining multiple steps in word problems. And sometimes word problems can get a little tricky when we're doing more than one more than one operation in a problem. So what I want to do today is talk to you a little bit about how we can unpack these word problems so that we can really understand what's happening in the word problem, so we can understand what the problem is asking us to do. And we can strategize how to pull out the information that we need, and what to do with these quantities in there in these numbers, remembering that, you know, we need to be flexible thinkers. And there are many different ways that we can approach mathematical word problems. There are many different ways to solve them. So one strategy that you might have might be different than the strategy that your partner has next to you. All right. So today for that purpose. I'm going to just talk through how I think about this word problem. All right, I'm going to give you a think aloud to see how I'm understanding it, and it might be a little different than how you would understand it. And that's totally fine. The other thing, I want to just remind everyone, and we're going to take a deep breath before we get started. Sometimes with these multi step problems, and rounding and operations, it can be a little overwhelming. So before we get started, let's all go ahead and just take one really big breath in and let it out. I don't know about you, but for me, that really helps my brain to refocus so that I can look at the problem with a clear mind. Okay, let's go ahead and I'm going to read my problem first. Right. Got my problem right here. It says Mrs. Malloy, orders, new supplies for the stem club. About how much will it cost to purchase 14 robots? Use the table below to answer the question. My table just has a little bit your table shows everything. Alright, so your tables up on the screen in front of the classroom. Okay, so I'm looking at this and I'm thinking what is happening here? What's going on in my story? What's what's going on in my problem? Well, Mrs. Malloy, she's ordering some supplies for our club. So she's ordering supplies. And then it's asking me how much right? How much will it cost to purchase robots? Robots. Okay, so we're buying some robots? How many robots? Let me think, okay, so it's telling me right here, I need to purchase 14 robots. So then I'm going to be thinking, Okay, how much do the robots cost? So I'm going to look down, up. Here's my supply list, right? So on my supply list, I've got ring lights. No, I've got coding robots that can be added. I've got stem kits, and I've got document cameras. So I'm gonna go back to where I see robots, right. And for me, I'm going to just put a star next to that, because then I know that's the one that I'm going to look at. And that's the number that I'm going to be looking at. So it tells me the robots. Oh, 189. But I need to get 14 of those. That's a lot. That's a lot of numbers. Okay. Let me read this again. Mrs. Malloy orders new supplies for the stem club. About how much will it cost to purchase 14 robots use the table. Alright. So I've got my robots, and I've got 14, I think what I want to do is round this number up, so it's an easier number to work with. So if I'm rounding 189, I think I'm gonna go up to 200 Rather than going down to 100, because I remember, anything more than 150 should go up. So I'm going to take $200 And I'm thinking, I'm probably going to need to multiply that right. If I need 14. I don't really want to add, although I could, I could also add 214 times or I could do 200 times 14. There are many different ways. I want you to come up with some ideas. Give me a\n",
      "Group A: Okay, so today we're gonna start out with this question. Let's read it together. A this mom is 28 years old, her grandma is 51. How much older is Ava's grandma than her mom. So we want to figure out how much older his grandmother is than her mouth. So in the story, it tells us that her grandma is 51. So we're gonna circle 51. That also tells us that Ava's mom is 28. We're gonna circle 28. So we want to see how much older is Eva's grandma than her mom. So we'll underline the question because this is what we're solving for. So let's go back to 51, and 20. So we're going to write these numbers down. So her grandma is 51, we're going to use G for grandma. And she's 51. Her mom is 28. We'll use M for mountain. And she's 28. So how can we figure out how much older the grandma is than the mom? And how do we know that the grandma is older? Because 51 is more than 28? So a way to think about this is, how much is in between right here? How much would we have to jump to get from 28 to 51? Well, let's find out, we can use a number line to help us. So I'm going to draw a number line out on the board. And it goes on, you know, numbers are infinite. But we're going to start at 20. We're gonna start at 28 right here, because this is the smaller number. So 28 is going to go here. And we want to end at 51. And this space in between is going to tell us how much older it was grandmother's because it's going to tell us how much how many years it will take to get from 28 years to 51 years. So we want to see how much this jump is? And what was the question mark? What what does that question mark represent? It represents pm amount of years or the number of years that the grandma is older than the mom. So let's try to figure that out. So how can I get to 28 for 51? Well, I know that 20 is kind of close to 30. So let's try to get to 30. Next. So I want to get to 30 from 28 to 30. What I have to jump to get to 30, I would jump forward to so I would add 28 plus two equals 30. Now I'm at 30, which is closer to 51. But not quite there yet. So I'm going to jump to another easy number 4040 is again, closer to how much is in between 30 and 40. How did I get to 30 from 40. I added 1030 plus 10 is equal to 40. Not quite there yet, either. So I'm going to jump on number 10 To get to 50. So I went from 40 to 50 by adding 10 Because 40 plus 10 is equal to 50. Now I'm at 50. And I want to get to 51. So we're almost there. So how can I get to 5251. Right jumping 150 plus one is equal to 51. So now I'm there, which is awesome. But we're not done yet. Now we have to take all of these jumps that we just did, and add them together. So two plus 10 plus 10 plus one is going to give us our answer. So two plus 10 is equal to 12 plus 10 plus 112 plus 10 is equal to 22 plus 122 plus one is equal to 23. So that means that the grandmother is 23 years older than the mom, and how did we get this? Because our one big jump to get to 28 to 51 we jumped pull us 23 years, so that means that 28 Pull us 23\n",
      "Group A: Okay, so it says if someone is 28 years old her grandma is 51. How much older is Ava's grandma than her mom. So we know in this problem that Eva's mom is 28 years old. We also know that Ava's grandma is 51 years old. So we are going to compare these two numbers, and we know that the difference between them is unknown. So I set up this problem as blank, plus 28 equals 51 years old. So, we want to find the difference between Ava's of mom and Ava's grandma. So I took 20 years old, and we want to try to get to 51 years old to find the difference between them. So I took my 10s and I kept adding on until I got close to 51. So I did 28 plus 10, which equals 38. And then I did 38 plus 10 to get for you. But I'm not there yet. So I needed to find a number that was at 51. So I knew if I did 48 4940 840-950-5013 More would get me to 51 years old. So I added up all of these numbers 10 plus 10 plus 10 to get 23 years, so Ava's grandma is 23 years older.\n",
      "Group A: Hey, fifth grader. So we're going to work through this word problem together today. This our problem is going to combine some skills that we've already learned. So I really want you to open your mind before we start and think, in new ways that combine new skills you've learned. So I know we've mostly practice these skills in isolation. Now we're going to combine them. So your brain is going to have to work to combine these two skills. So the question reads, Mrs. Malloy orders new supplies from the STEM lab. About how much will it cost to purchase 14 coding robots use the table to answer the question. So I'm going to look down at this table. And I'm looking at the tables labeled supplies and it gives me a list of four things that people buy, or that Miss Malloy has ordered for the stem club. And again, my question is asking me about how much will it cost to purchase 14 coding robots? Okay, so I see that Cody robots is listed in the supplies, and then three other things are listed. But to me, those seems like those might just be there to confuse me and maybe throw me off a little because the question doesn't ask me about ring lights, or STEM craft kits or document cameras. So if it was me, I would probably go ahead and just maybe put a line through those three things, so that my brains not getting confused by those other numbers. And really, what that tells me is the only number I'm really focused on is 189. So 189 Oh, but I forgot something. It's $189, not just 189. So I'm going to read this question again. It says about how much will it cost to purchase 14 Cody robots? Okay, so I already know they've provided me more information than what I need. So I got rid of that information. That's not helpful to me. Another key word I'm noticing in this problem? Well, first, I'm noticing they want me to purchase 14, coding robots. And they want to know how much it will cost. But they're not asking me exactly how much will it cost? They're saying up about how much it will cost? So it sounds to me like they want an estimate of how much it will cost. They don't need an exact number. There. Okay, if you round the number. So I'm going to look at that 189 and think to myself, what's a number that could round two? That would make my math a little bit easier? So for me, I would probably round it. Well, there's really two ways you could do it, you could round it up to 100 ID. Or if I want to remember that's much easier to work with. I could round it up to 200. So I'm going to look back at the problem again, it says about how much will it cost to purchase 14 coding robots. So I think that I probably am going to want to round it to 190 because I think that if I round all the way up to two\n",
      "Group A: Hi guys, today we are doing a think aloud for this story problem so that you guys can follow along with my reasoning and I can explain how I think about a problem like this. CeCe is making cookies with white and brown sugar, she puts two eighths cup of white sugar in the cookie dough. Then she puts in the brown sugar she is seven eighths cup of sugar and all how much brown sugar is in the recipe. So the first thing I did is I went ahead and underline the important information, two eighths cup of white sugar seven eighths cup of sugar and all I think about this I know I know how much white sugar there is and I know the total amount of sugar but I don't know how much brown sugar there is. So I'm going to make a PART part whole diagram will show you in a second it's my diagram so far. I put a W here to show white sugar than that box and brown sugar will be in this box. So I know I have two eighths Cup and the white sugar and then down here. In the total I have seven eighths cup this word diagram filled it looks like I have two eights cup of white sugar seven eighths cup total. And we don't know how much brown sugar. So I know if I have seven eighths total. I know that two ways to figure out how much is left over find the difference. I can do seven eighths minus two eighths. And we know that when we subtract fractions with like denominators, the denominator stays the same and we subtract the numerators. Seven minus two is five. So we get five eights which means that CC used five\n",

We want to know how much older Ava's grandma is telling us that her grandma is already older, but we want to know by how many years and we know that her grandma's 51 years old, and her mom is 28. So if we do Deewan minus 28 years old. Then that is how we can solve for how many years is a was grandma older than he was mom. So when we do it, the one minus 20 We're already going to do the we're sorry, I should pause on this. When we do 51 minus 28. We will be getting that Amy's mom is 23 years older than her.

So far it looks a little like this 189 times 14 Because we need it you know that it costs 189 So, what we could do we could do this in many ways. Simple way we could probably do 100 We can break this apart 100 So fun good times 14 won't be 1414 82 46468 in terms of 123456 711.

So I'm going to look for my coding robots. And I see that they are $189. There, I'm gonna clean it out. But there's no there's no sense involved. So it's just dollars. So the first way I might go about this is just trying to do 189 times for team and I could figure it out this way. Or I could do a table. So I have my robots and the cost. I know one robot is $189.

There were 26 students in the cafeteria, there were 42 students on the playground, how many more students were on the playground than in the cafeteria. When I read this to myself, I was thinking about who was involved in the situation. So I know that we're talking about students, because it's talking about 26 students being in the cafeteria, and 42 students being on the playground. So I drew a little diagram to help me remember the numbers. So I know that there's 26 students in the cafeteria. So I'm just going to draw a little 26 students in the cafeteria 42 Students playground. So I know that 42 is a bigger number than 26. So I know that there's more students on the playground, then in the cafeteria. So the question that's being asked is how many more students were on the playground than in the cafeteria? I know that this is a subtraction problem, because it asks how many more so I'm going to take the number 42. And I'm going to make a subtraction problem out of it. So I'm gonna say 42 minus 26 equals some amount of number. We don't know yet. That's what we're trying to figure out. So I'm thinking to myself, I know that there's more students on the playground. So that's why I have to subtract it from 26. Because we're trying to figure out how many more students were on the playground. Then in the cafeteria, which was 26 students. So I'm going to do 42 minus 26. I'm going to choose to solve this. The break apart method, so I'm going to turn 42 and 240 and two, and I'm going to turn 26 into 20, and six, so I know that 41 minus 20 is 20. And I know that six minus two is four. So I'm going to add 20 plus four and get 24. So I know that there was 24 More students on the playground than in the cafeteria.\n",
      "Group A: This question says CeCe is making cookies with white and brown sugar, she puts two eighths cup of white sugar in the cookie dough. Then she puts the brown sugar in. She has seven eighths cup of sugar and all how much brown sugar is in the recipe. So to begin this problem, we are going to underline all the important parts of the question. So we'll start by underlining to eighths cup of white sugar, because that's one of the quantities that will be one of the quantities that we'll be looking for or looking at. And then we'll also underline seven eighths cup of sugar in all because that is the other quantity that we have. And the last thing we'll underline is how much brown sugar is in the recipe because that's the quantity that we're looking for. So to begin this, we can use a direct modeling approach, which means we can draw out this example using circles. So on the first part, we're going to have seven circles to represent seven circles over eight circles to represent the seven eighths cup. And we also figured out that this is subtraction, we can do this as subtraction because you are looking for the other quantity. So it's one part that you're looking for, and you have one of the holes so you have to do the whole minus one of the parts to find the last part. So we're doing seven over eight minus two over eight because we have two eighths cup of white sugar to find the brown sugar. So when we do seven minus seven eighths minus two eighths, you can just do seven minus you can just do seven minus two because they have the same denominator. So with that you would get five over eight, which means that your solution to this problem will be five eight\n",

      "Group B: Today we're going to be solving a word problem together. So the word problem we're going to be solving is Diego and his cousin are sharing a pie. Diego ate four tenths of the pie. His cousin ate some more. They ate nine tenths of the pie together. How much of the pie did his cousin ate? So let's, let's break this down. Let's look at each sentence individually and what it's telling us. The first sentence is telling us that Diego Diego and his cousin are sharing a pie. Do we need to really are there any really significant numbers to the or, or aspects of the problem that we need to write down? I don't think so. I think it's just telling us what's going on with this problem. The next and it says Diego ate four tenths of the pie. So I'm going to write d, four tenths, so that we so d means Diego ate four tenths. His cousin ate some more. So we know that his cousin, which I'm going to write C, for cousin ate some more pie, but we don't know. So I'm going to write a question mark next to see, because we don't know how much his cousin ate, we just know he ate some. So we know together. So c and d equals they ate nine tenths of the pie. So we can write this in a number sentence, can't we? We can write we know that Diego ate four tenths of the pie. Plus what his cousin ate, which we don't know. So we're going to put a question mark equals nine tenths. So what do you think we need to do to solve this problem? How do we find out how much the cousin ate? Could we write this number sentence in a different way? I think we could. I think we can maybe write to find the difference. While we know the denominator is the same. We know they're both tents. So we just need to find out how many tents his cousin ate. So I think since we know the total is nine tenths, okay. And we know that Diego ate four tenths. So whatever his cousin ate must be nine tenths subtracted by what Diego ate. To find the difference to find what else was. So nine tenths minus four tenths. Since the denominators are the same, we know that we can just subtract those numerators. So what is nine minus four? Five, so five tenths would be our answer. Diego ate five tenths of the pie. And what's another way we would write five tenths if we think about a pie and it's split into 10 pieces, and five of them are gone. How much is that? That will be half so Diego ate half of the pie and that is the same thing as writing\n",
      "Group B: So, I would start this problem off by reading it. So it says CeCe is making cookies with white and brown sugar. So, the objective here so far is cooking. And she's cooking with white and brown sugar. She puts two eight cups of white sugar in the cookie dough. So now we have our first pair of numbers. Then she puts in the brown sugar. She has seven eight cups of sugar in all or in total, how much brown sugar is in the recipe. So by looking at these numbers, they are both over eight. So fraction is over eight, the total is going to be eight cups of something. It says that she's dealing with white and brown sugar. It says she puts two eighths of a cup of white sugar in the cookie dough right here represents the first number two eighths of white sugar into the cookie No, then it says she adds brown sugar but we're not sure how much brown sugar she has added yet so we can just leave that part blank. So so far, she has two eights plus unknown. And then that's going to equal it says she has a total at the very end of sugar used was seven eighths. And that was the total. So they gave us one number to work with. And then they gave us what the total was going to be. So how we're going to figure this out is we can draw a picture we already know that it's going to be out of eight total pieces. So we can draw a rectangle or square what is ever easier for you to represent so right here, we have a total let's just pretend they're equal sized pieces, but we have a total of eight pieces here. Because it says it has already given us what the whole is or the denominator is which is eight two which is that is my withdraw eight pieces. Where do you know she has used to who eights. So she has used two eighths of the white sugar, that is two eights. And to better represent it, we can just write in small numbers underneath each individual piece, what each individual piece is worth. So right here, just for reference, this piece is one eight, that's one eight, that's when I that's when I and so long. So right now there are two pieces of 1/8 colored in which is two eighths then it says she has seven in all if we had if we color it in, so there's seven pieces colored and in total. The question is, how many additional pieces are we coloring in to get to seven. So this we can make a quick note as to AIDS, so that's 1828384858687 eighths. This box right here is what would bring us to seven eighths which is all the sugar she used in total. So just looking at these pieces, how many additional pieces here are we going to have to color in? That's going to be five so since the total is seven eighths, and she started off with two eight\n",
      "Group B: So the first problem we're going to be looking at is Ava's mom is 28 years old, her grandma is 51. How much older is Ava's grandma than her mom? So there's a lot of people in this problem for me to think about. So when I'm thinking about this problem, I want to think about two different. Something that helps me when I'm thinking about problem people is to just draw a little stick figures and label them so that I know who's in this problem. So we're thinking about who who is in this problem? Well, first we have Ava, so this could be a VA right here. And it says that Eva Eva, or it was Mom, this is Ava's mom. And it says that it was mom is 28 years old. So I'm gonna put Ava's mom at mom's age right underneath her, so that I know that I can differentiate the two of the people in this problem. So then we have her grandma. So whose grandma are we thinking about? If we're talking about Ava's Mom, we're probably thinking about Ava's grandma. So I'm going to say Ava's grandma is right here. And it says that her grandma is 51. So underneath Ava's Grandma, I'm going to write her age just like I did with Ava's mom and say that M Ava's grandma is 51. So, this problem was a little bit confusing to me at first because I even wrote Ava right here instead of Ava's mom. So we have technically three people in this problem, right? We have Ava, we have Ava's mom and we have her grandma. However, when we read over the problem again, we can see that Ava isn't really in the problem. We're just comparing Ava's grandma and her mom's age. Let me read it again. Ava's mom is 28 years old. Her grandma is 51. How much older is grave? Ava's grandma than her mom? So knowing that we have to compare the two we're thinking about what are we trying to do with this problem? What are what are we doing with the quantities that we have? What are we looking for? We're looking for how much older Ava's grandma is that her mom? So something that I would do here is maybe represent know that Ava's grandma seems to be older than her mom. So, now I want you to try by yourself and see how you could compare Ava's grandma's age from her mom's age.\n",
      "Group B: So the problem is mp3 players for all 18 classrooms. So if MB, mp3 players are $98, and we can round that up to $100, which is easier to multiply by 18. And then that gives us 1800. Because we take the place values. Yeah, so then that would be 1800. But then we need to know 18 times two, because when we did 98, we rounded up to 100. So we did that 18 times. So we need to know what is 18 times two to figure out how much we need to take away. So I know that 18 times two equals 36. So then I can take 36, away from 80, or 1800. So if I wanted to take 30 away from that, then that would be 17 71,770. Because I know that 100 minus 30 is 70. And so the eight goes down to seven, we're taking one one hundredths place away, and then if I subtract six more, then I know that now 10 minus six is four. So the 1000s place stays the same, the one hundreds place is the same, the 10s place is going to change because the zeros is the zero is also going to change. So we're bumping it down even more. So instead of 70 it would be 64. So it would cost $1,764 There's my math Oh\n",
      "Group B: Okay, so prove nothing to this problem. The problem we have is about how much would it cost to buy an mp3 player for all 18 classrooms in your school? So we're going to use the table that gave us to answer the questions at it says about, so we don't have to get an exact answer. So let's see, it gives us the price of a CD player is $74. Do we need to know that? I don't think so. The smart the price of an mp3 player is $98. Well, that's what we're looking for. This price of a smart speaker is $199. But our pushing doesn't ask about a smart speaker. And then the price of an am FM radio is $29. But again, our problem doesn't ask about this. So our problem again says about how much would it cost to buy mp3 players for all 18 classrooms in your school. So we need to take the price of an mp3 player and either add it together at times or multiply it by 18. To figure out our total, but we don't want to multiply 98 by 18, because that's a little bit difficult. So what else can we do to estimate or get about how much it would cost again, it doesn't have to be an exact number. So we could take the 98 and round it to our nearest friendly number that we like which would be 100. And so we could just round the mp3 player price to be about $100. Now if we did this and we bought $100 mp3 player for 18 classrooms, then we have 118 times. So if you multiply 18 by 100 All you have to do is have 18 and add the two zeros so our total price\n",
      "Group B: Okay, so we are going to solve a math problem today. And the problem is the ageless mom is 28 years old, her grandma is 51. How much older is ageless grandma than her mom. Now, those are pretty big numbers. But if we write draw a picture, I think we can solve them. So let's figure out what's really going on here. Ava's mom is 28 years old. So let's write that on our paper. She's 20. Oops. She is 28 years old. And her grandma is 51. Really far away. 51. Awesome. Let's draw a line to connect those. Kind of like number one. Okay, and since they're far away, what am I looking for? What I think we're looking for is to see how much older is Eva's grandma than her mom. So we're starting off with how old Ava's mom is. Let's do jumps of 10 to get to 51. Since if you want is really far away. So let's mix them up. Let's go from 28. We'll do a jump on our number line to get to 30. Are we at 51 yet? No. You have to do another jump 38 to 48. One more jump of 10. So two plus 10. More plus 10. More. Right 51 yet? Not quite. We have a little bit more. If we do 48 to 5148 is that 10 more? It isn't. So we have do a smaller jump 44 950 51 out to jump of three. Three more. We have our 210s our jump of 110 our jump of 210s. That's 20 plus three more 2323 years. That tells us that Ava's grandma is 23 years older than Ava's mom\n",
      "Group B: So today I'm going to be doing a think aloud to explain my thinking of how I'm going to solve this problem that we have. So let's read the question, CeCe is making cookies with white, and brown sugar, she puts to a nice cup of white sugar in the cookie dough, then she puts in the brown sugar, she has seven ace cup of sugar in all, how much brown sugar is in the recipe. So I'm going to ask myself, what's going on here. So we know that CeCe is making some cookies. And she's using white and she's using brown sugar. So what we don't know, what do we not know in this problem? Let me read here, we know that she puts to a nice cup of white sugar. And then she puts the brown sugar. So we don't know how much brown sugar she puts in there. And that's what our question asks us how much brown sugar is in the recipe. So usually what I already know about problems like this, I need to find out what I need to know, which is how much brown sugar. And what else does the problem tell us. So the problem also tells us that she has seven ace a cup of sugar in all in total. So that means the brown and the white sugar together in her cookies is going to be seven ace. So let's try and try and show my thinking here. So I know that this is her cookie dough bowl. And I know that she's going to put in seven ace a cup of sugar. So if this is a cup of sugar, and we know that it's seven, eight in total. So then the story tells us that she puts to ace white sugar. So that's to ace white sugar so we still don't know how much brown sugar is in here. So we'll jump right in and try and solve this. Let me ask myself what's going on between these these fractions here. So this is our total sugar. And we know what part of our total is, is white, and the other part is brown. So I need to figure out how much Brown is in this seven ace. So maybe I can draw this another way. Because I'm still a little confused on how to get this number how to get this brown sugar number. So if I have this box represents my white sugar, so I know this to ace white. And then I also know that she put some brown sugar in. She also put some brown sugar in. But I don't know what this brown sugar number is quite yet. But I know that it's brown. And then she also said that it was seven ace total. So then I could say this represents seven, Ace sugar in all, so now I can see exactly what I need to figure out I need to figure out what is the fraction of brown sugar that she added to this recipe. So my answer is going to look like this CEC added blank brown sugar into her cookies. So how can I use these numbers to solve this unknown that I have here? I have the end amount and I have a part of that whole of the sugar. So why don't you guys try and figure out how much brown sugar with the visuals that I have given you guys today.\n",
      "Group B: Okay, so when we're looking at the problem CC's making cookies with bright white and brown sugar, she puts two eight cups of white sugar in the cookie dough and put some brown sugar. She now has seven, eight cups of sugar and all how much brown sugar is in the recipe. So we want to break down this problem. So that we can understand and dissect what we know and what we don't know how to get to our final total. So when we're approaching the problem with a lot of fractions and a lot of words, we want to write down what we know. So I wrote down what we know, we know we have two eighths cup of what sugar, we added some kind of amount of brown sugar, and we got seven eight cups total. We want to know how many how much brown sugar she added. So when we look at it, we're starting with two it's cup of sugar. And then we're at we're adding some kind of amount here to get seven eighths. But if we think back into our minds, when we think about adding and subtracting fractions, if we think real hard, we might remember one solid rule. And that we add or subtract fractions, the denominators need to stay the same. So that net gives us and so we know that both the original starting point and the ending starting point, have an eight and the diameter. So we can fill this one in and put an eight there. And now our problem is focusing just solely on the top part of the equation. Two plus one will give us seven. And so now we have set up our problem, we've dissected the problem. Together, we've taken out the information we need the information. We know how we know basic problems and when it comes to adding and subtracting fractions. So we now set up the problem just as we need with our no information or not no information on what we want to know information to now add and figure out the problem. So with the problem, we're set up, we're going to count from two to seven to give us our answer. So if we go to 45672 I missed one Oopsies 234567 We know now that she added five eighths of a cup of brown sugar to give us our total of 70\n",
      "Group B: So this problem says, how much would it cost to buy mp3 players for all 18 classrooms in your school? Use the table below to answer the questions. So this is a little tricky because we have a lot more numbers and words and meaning to for this problem. In this chart that's titled price of electronics, we're only going to look at mp3 player. And if you look to the right of it, it says that they are $98. There are two different ways that we can solve this problem. Something that's a little bit more complex is doing 98 times 18 To get our answer, but that's not what we're going to be doing today. So, to represent this, I drew out 18 different circles to represent the 18 classrooms. And inside of each of the circles I wrote 90 to represent that it is $98 in each circle. To solve this problem. We're going to add 98 up and up and up and up until we do 18 To get us our final answer. I know this is a little bit tricky, but I did this because we have 18 classrooms with $98 in each\n",
      "Group B: So in this problem, it is CeCe is making cookies with white and brown sugar. She puts two eighths of a cup of white sugar into the cookie dough. Then she puts in the brown sugar. She has seven eighths cup of sugar in all. So how much brown sugar is in the recipe? And so what is it asking here. And so first we're going to think about this without any numbers in it and try to figure out what exactly it is that we're finding. So we know that CeCe is making cookies with white and brown sugar. And we know that she has already put in her white sugar. And then she puts in her brown sugar. And then she has a certain amount of sugar overall. And so we're trying to find how much brown sugar is in the recipe. And so we start with two eighths of a cup of white sugar. So we put in the two the two eighths of a cup of white sugar. And then she puts in this brown sugar, and all of a sudden it goes up. And so we're trying to find out how much it's gone up after we've already put in the white sugar. When we put in the brown sugar, how much is it increasing? How much did it go up. And so we know that then once it's up that she has seven eighths of a cup of sugar overall of both brown and white sugar together. So we're trying to find how much brown sugar is in the recipe. And so we have white sugar and brown sugar. And so here, this is kind of representing so we have we have our our bowl with our cookie dough in it. And we pour in the two, two eighths of a cup of white sugar. And then it's gonna go up to seven eighths of a cup of sugar and all after she puts in the brown sugar. So we're trying to find the difference between right here, that black part that's not filled out yet. And this part here that has been filled up by the brown sugar so you're trying to find how much more sugar she put in to get to\n",

We're going to skip count each five and label them. 12345123412345234123 And then we have five times four. Five times four is 23. More is 23.

We have Ava, and it's her family we're talking about also have her mom and her grandma. And we know that it was a grandma is older than her mom, or trying to figure out how much older her markets so I would think about it is we're trying to get the amount of years in between a grandma and April's mom in order to figure out how much older so there's many different ways you can think about that. And I want to see what you guys are thinking and go for it. And let's see what you come up with.\n",
      "Group B: Okay, so the word problem we're going to talk about today is as follows. Ava's mom is 28 years old, her grandma is 51. How much older is Ava's grandma than her mom? So I'm gonna start by thinking, what is this question asking me? So, based on what I've seen, or what I've read, it's asking me how much older is Ava's grandma than her mom? So when we answer this question, I answer will probably look something like this. Ava's grandma is blank years older than her mom. So first, we start by looking at the numbers that we have. So I said, ageless mom is 28. And her grandma is 51. So I could start by asking myself, How can I figure out how much age is in between these two people? So we'll start by drawing a number line to help us see their age. So let's start by having a number one like this. And then I'll say so if we're going to put the younger age on this end of the number line, what, which personally publicly put ages, Ava's mom's age at 28? Or would we put grandma's age of 51 if we're trying to put the youngest age at this end? So 28 is going to go here to represent Chivas, mom's age. There, and then at the other end, we're gonna put her grandma's age, which is 51. So now we can see that there's a unknown number of years in between 28 and 51. And we're trying to figure out how many years are in between these two peoples that we can say how much older her grandmother is than Eva. Now we can start by thinking about maybe we can put some numbers in between here that make it easier for us to count up from that. We could think about doing something like 30 here 32 There 3436. A 4040 240-446-4850. Do you want to do something like this to help us see the ages in between and then count up? Or you could just subtract 51 from 28 to help us fine. So now I want you guys to go and see if you can solve it using either learn the methods we talked about or\n",
      "Group B: Alright, so today we're going to be doing a word problem. And we're problems can be difficult and scary and when we look at them the first time because there's a lot of words and numbers, and we have to decipher and decide what these words and numbers mean. So, first, we're going to go ahead and read the problem together, and we're going to read it slowly. And we're going to go ahead and decide what each of these quantities mean and how we're going to use them. So CeCe is making cookies with white and brown sugar. So usually, what I like to do here is I'm going to go ahead and write down, she's using white sugar and brown sugar, because there's probably going to be some kind of number associated with the white and one with the brown. So here, I just go ahead and write down white and brown. So she puts two eighths kg of white sugar in the cookie dough. Okay, so now we know that she has two eighths of white sugar, so I'm gonna go ahead and just write that below white. So now I know that she has to eight of white sugar. Then she puts in brown sugar. Okay, so we know that she also adds brown sugar to the mix, but they don't tell us how much brown sugar. She has seven eighths, sugar and all how much brown sugar is in the recipe. So now we know that she has seven eighths total. So this is what I have written on my paper right now, two eighths of white sugar, we don't know how much brunch or what seven eighths. So the way that I think it would be easiest to look at this problem is we're gonna go ahead and draw out a picture. So we know that she has to eat of white sugar. So go ahead and just draw that out like this. And then we know that she has some brown sugar as well. So I'm gonna go ahead and draw that. But we don't know how much so I'm gonna draw a question mark. Next to that this is this is our total. So then we would know that all of this even though we don't know how much brown sugar, we know that the total is seven eighths. So this is what I drew. So now that we have our weight, sugar quantity and our total quantity, I can think of a couple of ways that we could solve this problem here is another way that it can be written. And now that we have this information, you guys can go ahead and solve the problem on your own\n",
      "Group B: Hi, class. So the problem today that we are looking at is about how much would it cost to buy an and p3 player for all 18 classrooms and our school, we're going to use this table. So on this table, we see we have a CD player, mp3 player, smart speaker, and am an FM, watch a lot of numbers, but by reading back through our problem, how much it would cost to buy an mp3 player, we know that we're just going to look at the numbers that go with the mp3. Now, on also reading this problem, we're gonna we're going to focus on the about. So that does not mean we need the exact answer. We're going to work on our estimations That is correct. So first way to look at this is I'm going I'm going to write I'm going to write, so this, this is the number that we know and that is exactly for one mp3 player. But we don't want one. We want 18. So can anyone no one can look at this and tell me that what 98 times 18 would be that's, that's not possible. So what we can do is break it up into something that we do know. And we do know how to multiply by 10. It's very easy. That is a spontaneous. So we are going to start by multiplying by 10. So that we multiply by 10. And just add a zero. So we know it'd be $980 for 10 mp3 players, but we weren't 18. And I don't know what 180 times eight would be. So again, we're we're gonna estimate by another group of 10. Because 18 is close to close to 20. And what we're going to it's, it's about we don't need the exact answer when we're going to do we're going to get our about in a way that we know how to do. So again, we're gonna look at this and we're just going to add another zero. So we know now that getting 20 mp3 players is going to be $99,800 which is close to eight tape. So since we have the about answer, that's all we need.\n",
      "Group B: Okay class today we are looking at a word problem about how much would it cost to buy mp3 players for all 18 classrooms in your school? Use the table to answer the question. So let's see, what do we know here? We know that we are looking for how much would it cost for mp3 players. So let's look at this chart. We know that we have mp3 players, we don't need to look at anything else because that's all we're doing is looking at mp3 players. And then we know we're looking for 18 classrooms let me think here, I saw a key word in the problem. Does anyone know what that key word is? About? Correct. So we're looking about how much and mp3 players cost? About how much do you guys correct $100. And I'm looking for that for 18 classrooms. So I want you guys to draw a picture of 18 classrooms and figure out about how much that's going to cost it all.\n",
      "Group B: Okay, word problems can be very challenging and the complex complexity of the word problems can confuse us on what they're really asking what we know what we don't know. So we're going to break down this word problem together. So we focus on what do we know, when we look at the problem? It says Ava's mom is 28 years old. Her grandma is 51. How much older is Amish grandma to her mom. So I wrote it out so that we can break it up because it breaking it up allows us to kind of see everything like in a simple, simple way that we know the numbers. So we have a was mom is 28. Her grandma is 51. We want to know how much older Ava's grandma is two. So when we think we think in our mind, what kind of problem might this be? Do we want to set it up as addition? Or do we want to set up as attraction, we both we know how to do both of those problems. So when we think about it, how much more older is grandma to mom. So I chose to set it up as a subtraction problem, but you could set it up as an addition problem as well. So I have 51, because that's the bigger number. And we know when we do subtraction, we need to put the bigger number first minus the 28. That will have how old Emma's mom is, and then this equals, and then we will find our problem together. We also consider the problem as a change unknown problem. In addition, if we have we know whatever the change is going to give us 51. And we're starting at 28. Like that, so we could set it up both ways. But the best way to approach a word problem when it gets really confusing, is writing out the things we do know and the things we don't know. And that's what we just did. So your next problem, you're going to break it down, work it out, and we'll think through together\n",
      "Group B: So, you guys are very comfortable with adding together fractions, especially with like denominators. So today we're going to be doing a word problem that bounces off of this idea, and we'll put this into practice. So today we have the problem, CeCe is making cookies with white and brown sugar, she puts two eighths cup of white sugar in the cookie dough. Then she puts in the brown sugar. She has seven eighths cup of sugar and how much brown sugar is in the recipe. So in this problem, the first thing we should think is what are we looking for. So we know that CeCe is making cookies with white sugar and brown sugar. And we're given how much white sugar she uses. So she uses two eighths white sugar, but we don't quite know how much brown sugar she uses. I think it's very important to look at this sequentially and break it down step by step. So we know we have two cups of white sugar, then she puts in the brown sugar. That's the next step. But do we know how much it says Not quite yet. But fortunately, we are given it's a part on non-problem, we are given the total amount of sugar that she adds to the cookies. So if in this problem she uses seven eighths cup of sugar and all and we're given how much white sugar she uses, and means the part we're trying to find is the brown sugar. So to break it down, we know that she puts in two beats cup sugar white sugar we can use this to represent the two eighths cup of white sugar she used in the problem. And on this part of MSA CC ads and brown sugar. But we don't know how much so we have a little box here and we could even do a question mark if we wanted to. But we want to fill it in the nursery. We don't know what this number is yet. We know it's brown sugar to be no we don't know what that number is. How do you think we could find out what this number is? We're given the total amount of sugar right? So for getting the Tula sugar how much sugar did CeCe use it all? Well, CeCe used seven eighths cup of sugar in all she used seven eight cups sugar seven foods. So this represents seven eighths cup in these two quantities add up to equal this, that's the relationship between the three of these can be added together to equal this one. So we're trying to find out this broken or unknown problem. So we can tell if we know what this part of the seven eighths is. You know that whatever's left over is supposed to go here. So you can think of this as subtraction as addition whatever you want, whatever is easiest for you. But here we can just think number can be combined with two eighths equals seven eighths. So we can do this if there's seven eighths is the total we can write this as a problem. And two eighths are given. We're trying to figure this we know that it can be over eight. So what numbers may fill in the blanks here, d equals seven. We know two plus five, seven. We can check it that works.\n",
      "Group B: Okay, so we're going to be looking at and we're going to use that we can use in the future, looking at a word problem. So the word problem we have is cc cookies with white and brown sugar. She puts two eighths of white chips. And she puts in the brown sugar. She has 70 cups of sugar. How much sugar is in there? Okay, so we'll definitely know is the cup white sugar white sugar. This represents white sugar in the cookies. We know that she has seven, eight cup of sugar and what does it not tell us? It doesn't how much brown sugar. So we have a space here where we don't know how much sugar there is. This is what we're trying to figure out. What we do know is that we have seven eighths of seven eighths cup of sugar in total in the recipe. So this is going to represent seven eighths of sugar total. This equals white and brown sugar. So what we're trying to figure out is this here, how could we figure this out? With this on your own and we'll come\n",
      "Group B: Okay. All right. So this question is asking how much would it cost to buy an mp3 player for all 18 classrooms in your school? So we are given a table where we know the price of a CD player, the price of an mp3 player is a smart speaker and an am FM radio. In this question, it is only asking us about the MP mp3 player. So that's the only thing that we need to focus on. For this question, I just circled it because it helps me see that we only need to worry about the $98 that the mp3 player costs. So how student might be able to solve this, if it were pretty low numbers with you can add 9818 times to account for the $98 per mp3 player for each 18 classroom. But an easier way to do this that is more concise is to just multiply 98 times 18 which will help the students practice multiplication skills and not have to add 9898 And so it's just a lot easier and so yeah, yet\n",
      "Group B: Let's see is making cookies with sugar puts it into its progression. And you should consider branch should use orange brown sugars so for this reason they know that she's using what sugar rush it and she used two weeks of white sugar in the recipe. We also know that she used seven eighths and tough so we need to find here is a difference of between those two fractions in order to do it, so we're gonna do 70s estimates in order to figure out how many or how much fracture there should used\n",
      "Group B: Hey class. So today we'll be working on a word problem. Um, remember your doctor has a few times and then we'll tackle it together as a team. So Ava's mom is 28 years old. Her grandma is 51. How much older is Ava's grandma? Then her mom? One more time. Okay, everyone close your eyes and really follow along with me. Ava's mom is 28 years old. Her grandma is 51. How much older is Ava's grandma than her mom? She have two people in this equation. We have Ava's mom and Ava's grandma. We know that Ava's mom is 28 years old. 28 years old. So let's write this down. So what mom favors mom and grandma variables will do an M for mom and G for grandma. So the mom is 28 and the grandma 5128 and 51 it is bad Toklas guys How do you think we should go about doing this to find a difference in the two because we're will our end goal is to look at the difference between the ages of 51 and 28. Yes, I think modeling would be a great idea Kevin. So how can we model this maybe a bar we can try to use a bar graph Perfect. Okay so mom is deaf or is 28 So I am going to draw draw up to 28 Oh, you're right. It'd be much easier than this using a number line printer this door number line okay we'll start with her mom is 28 years old and now we'll make little tick marks up to 51? Okay, so here if you guys can see, this is her mom 28 years old. And right here we have her grandma is 51. So you find a difference in the two ages right? Trying to count up from 28 to 5130 520-829-3031 30 to 3330 430-536-3730 830-940-4140 240-344-4540 640-748-4950 51 or I count those tick marks in between 1234 568-910-1112 1314 1516 1718 1920 2122 2324 25. So we have 23 Sweet there's between\n",
      "Group B: word problem that is asking us the difference and Ava and her grandmother's age. And it is asking us how much older is Eva's grandmother than her mom. So before we begin, let's think of this word problem as a picture in our mind. So we can think of Eva's mother who is 28 years old. So that's not very old. She's like, a younger lady and her grandmother is 51. So can you envision your mom and your grandmother standing together in a room. And now that we have that visual in our head, I am starting to think of how I can solve this problem with the materials, or the, the numbers that I have given to me already. So I have 28. And I have the number 51. So to show you how I would do this, I'm going to make a number line. And I'm going to put 58 At one end of my number line. And I'm going to put 28 on the other end of my number line. And as we know a number line starts with the smaller number. So 28 is going to be on the left 51 is going to be on the right, and we're going to count from 28 to 51. And to make this a little bit easier for ourselves, second graders, we know how to count by twos. So starting at 28, we're going to move two spaces up our number line and what number are we going to be at here, we're going to be at 30. And then we're going to have two more spaces, that's going to put us at 32. Two more 34. I want you guys to move on from 36 and I want you to count up to 51. Now you're probably going to get to a number and when you're counting by twos and then have to add a one to that number. So just be mindful of that when you're counting up your number line.\n",
      "Group B: All right, so our question is CeCe is making cookies with white and brown sugar, she puts two eighths a cup of white sugar in the cookie dough. Then she puts in the brown sugar. She has seven eighths cups of sugar and all how much brown sugar isn't the recipe. So what we can take from our question here is that CeCe is making cookies. And I bet they will be delicious. I would love a cookie right now. And inside of the cookies, there are two different types of sugar, there is white sugar, and there was brown sugar. And there's she puts a little bit of white sugar into her cookie dough. And then next she's going to put in the brown sugar. And we don't quite know how much brown sugar she puts in. But we know that at the end, there are seven eight cups of sugar at all. So she started off with just a little bit and at the ending, she's got a significantly larger amount of sugar. So what we have done here, and what we're looking for is our answer, which is how much brown sugar is in the recipe, we know about the white sugar, we know how much we have in total, we want to know how much brown sugar she's going to put in. So what we can start by doing is start off with a visual with a picture. And our picture for right now is going to be a bowl, it's a cookie bowl. And this is where we're going to be putting our sugar in. So we know that in total there are seven eighths of a cup of sugar in all of our cookies. We know that seven eighths is how much sugar is going to be there. So we have 718 size cups, which is the same as seven eighths of one cup. We also see that on the side we've got brown sugar, and then I can't see and then white sugar right here. So we know what's filling what we already know into our diagram, we know that she has two eighths of a cup of white sugar. two eighths of a cup can also be written as 218 size cups, which is what we know we have here. So we're going to color in one and to have our cups in our bowl. And we know that these are two one eighths. So we also know that we have seven eighths cups of sugar and all these seven eighths cups of sugar, we have two of them are white sugar. And we have how many leftover for brown sugar, we've got 12345 cups left over for brown sugar. So our brown sugar that's in our bowl is going to be the remaining left because we know we only have two types. And we've already filled in all of our white sugar. So we're going to put our brown sugar and all of our cups left. And we know that we have five cups left over. And those five cups. Each of those cups is one eight of a total cup. So we have 518 or 518 the size cups left over which can also be written as five eighths of one cup. So we've got 12345 cups of brown one eight size cups of brown sugar, and we've got 1218 size cups of white sugar. And we know that two and five together make seven and we know that these are all representative of 1/8 size cups. So we know that if out of all seven eights if the 218 size cups are white, then we have 518 size cups of brown sugar and our cookies. We also know that five cups sizes that are one eight is the same as one cup of five eighths. So in total we have five eighths of a cup of brown sugar. In all of our cookies we have five eighths of a cup of brown sugar in all of our cookies.\n",
      "Group B: Okay, so the problem we're working with is CeCe is making cookies with white and brown sugar, she puts two eighths cup of white sugar in the dough, then she put some brown sugar, she has seven eighths of a cup of sugar and all. So we are trying to figure out how much brown sugar she used in the recipe. So we're going to work through this. So in the future, you'll be able to do this on your own, and you will gain some mathematical thinking to make it easier for you. So what do we know, we know that white sugar is two eighths. We know that in total, she has seven cups, seven eighths of cup of white and brown sugar that's really important to understand. The relationship between white and brown in total is counting white and brown all together. We know the white sugar quantity. We are trying to figure out how much of that seven eighths is brown sugar. So how would you visualize this? Which, how would you represent this on a piece of paper it can be with a box method or a number line or however you choose. So I'll give you a few minutes to think about that and maybe throw some ideas out there. How would you visualize this next month gonna think about again, the relationship between these quantities. So we have two eighths white sugar. Over here, we have an unknown brown sugar. In total, we know that that's seven eighths. So we're trying to find this unknown quantity. fractions can be very confusing. So it is a lot easier to draw something out. That helps me but you can do whatever you think that helps you. So try and figure that up now that we know the quantities and what they mean and the relationships what we're trying to find. Try and figure that out.\n",

      "Group A: Okay, so I'm gonna read the problem out loud. There were 26 students in the cafeteria, there were 42 students on the playground, how many more students were on the playground than in the cafeteria. When I read this to myself, I was thinking about who was involved in the situation. So I know that we're talking about students, because it's talking about 26 students being in the cafeteria, and 42 students being on the playground. So I drew a little diagram to help me remember the numbers. So I know that there's 26 students in the cafeteria. So I'm just going to draw a little 26 students in the cafeteria 42 Students playground. So I know that 42 is a bigger number than 26. So I know that there's more students on the playground, then in the cafeteria. So the question that's being asked is how many more students were on the playground than in the cafeteria? I know that this is a subtraction problem, because it asks how many more so I'm going to take the number 42. And I'm going to make a subtraction problem out of it. So I'm gonna say 42 minus 26 equals some amount of number. We don't know yet. That's what we're trying to figure out. So I'm thinking to myself, I know that there's more students on the playground. So that's why I have to subtract it from 26. Because we're trying to figure out how many more students were on the playground. Then in the cafeteria, which was 26 students. So I'm going to do 42 minus 26. I'm going to choose to solve this. The break apart method, so I'm going to turn 42 and 240 and two, and I'm going to turn 26 into 20, and six, so I know that 41 minus 20 is 20. And I know that six minus two is four. So I'm going to add 20 plus four and get 24. So I know that there was 24 More students on the playground than in the cafeteria.\n",
      "Group A: Okay, so today we're working on a problem that reads Diego and his cousin are sharing a pie. Diego ate four tenths of the pie. His cousin ate some more the nine tenths of the pie together, how much of the pie did his cousin eat? So with this problem, I want us to think about some things that we know some things that we don't know. And what is that the problems asking us? And I want us to really focus on unpacking this quad this question so that we can better understand it and understand what it's asking of us and what each part of the question means. So when I reread, I want to ask myself, again, what are things that I know and what I what I don't know, and maybe highlight some of that stuff. So I'm gonna reread since Diego and his cousin are sharing a pie. Diego ate four tenths of the pie. So I know that Diego ate four tenths of the pie. And I know that four tenths a total would be 10 tenths. So we know that there's some left and we know of that 10 tenths, four of them were eaten by Diego. Then it says his cousin ate some more. So we know that his cousin ate some of the pie, but we don't exactly know how much of the pie he ate. And then it reads that they ate nine tenths of the pie together. So we know that Diego ate four tenths of the pie. And his cousin ate some amount. Well, we don't know what it represents just yet. But we know that together when you take what Diego ate, which was four tenths, and what is cognate, which we don't know what, how much he ate, but when we put it together, it makes nine tenths of the pie. So we want to try and ask ourselves, what is this question asking us and again, it's asking us how much of the pie did his cousin eat? So I know again, like I said earlier, that the total of the fraction of the pie is 10 tats. And we know from that 10 tenths, four of it was eaten, so that I might want to subtract. Now, with a fraction, these two fractions, they have the same denominator and the denominator is the bottom number, which is the total amount of the fraction. So I will subtract four tenths from 10 tenths. Now again, it's the total number so you can kind of leave the 10 alone. You don't have to do anything to it. But it will end up in your answer, you know that your answer is going to end up with the 10 underneath it, because that's part of the total. So then we just focus on 10 minus four, and we know 10 minus four equals six. So the unknown quantity of what his cousin ain't would be six tenths of the pie.\n",
      "Group A: All righty, so let's go over our problem. First, I'm going to be doing a think aloud. The reason I'm doing a think aloud is because when you say you're thinking out loud, and working through a problem, it really helps you clearly hear the steps you're taking, making you able to immediately catch those errors, and hoping you get the most accurate answer possible. So that's why I'm going to be showing you this strategy today. That being said, I'm going to start and I'm going to model what a think aloud looks like for you. Alrighty, so the first thing I think that I should do is read the problem out loud to myself. Mrs. Malloy orders new supplies for the stem club, about how much will it cost to purchase 14 coding robots? Use the table to answer the question. So on the table, what I would do if I was you, and I had a piece of papers, I would take a highlighter. And I would look at the list. And when I saw coding robots, I would highlight coding robots that would highlight the quantity next to it, which is 189. So we know that coding robots cost $189. And in the problem, I know two after reading it, that there are four teen years buying 14 coding robots. So I know that we're buying 14 coding robots, and I know that each one costs $189. Now I'm going to think about what I don't know about the problem. What I don't know about the problem is I don't know how much all of those coding robots are going to cost. I don't know how much Miss Malloy is going to have to pay if she buys 14 coding robots. So oh, sorry, my camera froze. So that's going to be what I'm looking for. Even though we're kind of estimating this or trying to figure out around how much it costs. I wrote on my little whiteboard the problem, and I'm going to work through it. Keep in mind, I have done done multiplication in this format, and a minute. So if I make mistakes, that's okay, because adults make mistakes, we all make mistakes. It's how we learn and grow. Nine times four equals 36. Four times ad equals 320. And four times 100 equals 400. So now I'm going to add that all up together and see what I get 657. So 756, is what I got. I'm just erasing it, so I can read it by the top and make room. So 756. Now I'm going to do 10 times nine, which equals 90. Then I'm doing 10 times ad, which equals which equals 100. Yeah, and then I'm gonna do 210 times 100, which equals 1000. Now, I'm going to add up all my quantities. So I have a six, five plus nine equals 14. And then I have eight plus eight. She was sick six, carry the one. So my answer is 2646. And yeah, so that's how I would have solved it in my think aloud strategy.\n",
      "Group A: they eight 910. So if this whole thing is nine would likely mean this whole thing is 10. And together, it 90 is likely that there should be about one slice left. So we have four already filled in. Now we have to get to nine. So let's fill in what his cousin ate. So we have 456789. So we have 12345. So here we can see that he ate five slices, and Diego, which is over here has eaten four and there's one slice leftover, so not including what Diego has eaten. We block out this and we count what his cousin has. We can see that his cousin has eaten 510 of the entire pie. And his cousin has eaten for 10. I mean, Diego has eaten Watson and his cousin has eaten. Together they ate nine tenths of the pie\n",
      "Group A: So on this board it says it's Mom was 20 years old, her grandma's 51 panel Childers, Ava's grandma than her mom. So with the information provided to us, we know that he was grandma is 51 years old. And we know that her mother, Ava's Mom, is 28. We want to know how much older Ava's grandma is telling us that her grandma is already older, but we want to know by how many years and we know that her grandma's 51 years old, and her mom is 28. So if we do Deewan minus 28 years old. Then that is how we can solve for how many years is a was grandma older than he was mom. So when we do it, the one minus 20 We're already going to do the we're sorry, I should pause on this. When we do 51 minus 28. We will be getting that Amy's mom is 23 years older than her. Ava's grandma is 23 years older than her mom. When we do the math\n",
      "Group A: Okay, class. So today I'm going to work through a math problem with you. So you can see how much thinking I do before I jump into solving the problem. Because when I jump into solving things, I don't pay attention to close details and what the problems actually asking me. So therefore I make errors. So the problem we're working with is there were 26 students in the cafeteria. There were 42 students on the playground, how many more students were on the playground and in the cafeteria. That's a lot of information. But I know that if I take my time, I can work through it, and I can solve it. So first, I think I should ask myself, what the problems actually about. I just read a lot. So let me think. So I know the problem is about students, their students in a cafeteria and there's also students on the playground, I like to go to the playground. So we have students in the cafeteria and students on the playground. Well, how many students do I have in the cafeteria? Let me reread. Oh, okay. So 26 students in the cafeteria. Okay. And then how many students child on the playground? Have you reread again? Okay, so 42 students on? Oh, there were 26 students in the cafeteria. And then there were 42 students on the playground. Okay, so 26 students in one place 42 students and other. Okay, so I know what the numbers mean. But what's the problem actually asking? It's asking me how many machines from the playground and in the cafeteria. Okay, so it's just asking me, there's more students on the playground, it's asking me how many more there are on the playground than in the cafeteria? Okay, well, I can make a drawing to help make thinking. So let me see 26 students in the cafeteria, spend more model. And then in a separate area, I'm gonna read 46 students. So by drilling the model, it kind of helps me visualize the problem. And I'll see solid easier. So I have 26 students in one area and 46 on the other. I want to know how many more on the playground I can think to myself, how much does it take to get from 26 to 46. So my problem may look like started 26. I need to figure out on number one how much it takes to get to 46 That's how I may solve it but I'm excited to see how you solve it.\n",
      "Group A: Okay, so our problem is Miss Molly orders new supplies for the stem Club. How much will it cost to purchase 14 coding robots? Use the table to enter the question.

So far it looks a little like this 189 times 14 Because we need it you know that it costs 189 So, what we could do we could do this in many ways. Simple way we could probably do 100 We can break this apart 100 So fun good times 14 won't be 1414 82 46468 in terms of 123456 711.

So now I'm thinking, what am I doing with these two numbers? So I think since we're trying to figure out how many more there are, I'm going to do 42 minus 16. So I would do for you to minus 16. And since you can't do two minus six, I would borrow from the four. Make that a three, make the two a 12 and then do 12 minus six equals six and then three minus two equals one.\n",
      "Group A: Okay. So today we will be trying to figure out with estimation how much it would cost for each 18 classrooms to buy an mp3 player, we can see from the table that an mp3 player costs $98. So here I have broken down that an mp3 player is $98. There are 18 classrooms, one way to think about this is breaking down 18 classrooms. So we know 10 plus eight equals 18. So we also know that each classroom for one, mp3 players $98. So here I've broken down, if we just do it by 10s. So ad $98 times 10s classrooms equals $980. So that's how much of a class for 10 mp3 players. So that takes part of our 10s. But now we still have eight classrooms remaining. So we know that at $98 is the cost of one mp3 player. So we can break it down into $98 times eight, but we can also add $98.08 times, we can know that that answer equals $784. So with that information, we can add our total of $980 for 10 classrooms plus $784 for a classrooms, which equals $1,764. For 18 classrooms, we can do this by breaking. So we broke down to understand our values of 18 by 10 by eight which helps estimate it into more reasonable numbers. Another way we could have done this was broken down our eight classrooms into five, and three, because five plus three equals eight. And since we have 10 above, we can divide 980 by half because five is half of 10. So if we do that, we know that half of that is 490. So we still have three classrooms remaining. So we could do 98 times three or 98 Three times which would have equaled 294. So now if we add 980, which is 10 classrooms, plus 490, which is five classrooms, plus 294, which is three classrooms, we can know on our side that 10 plus five plus three is 18 classrooms and the total over here. We know it's 4671 which is our answer we got originally so there are multiple ways of breaking down our thinking to help us estimate the problems\n",
      "Group A: So our problem is Ava's mom is 28 years old, her grandma is 51. How much older is Ava's grandma than her mom? What we're trying to figure out here is the difference between 28 and 51. And your heads think, how could we figure out the difference between 28 and 51. Now I'm going to show us one way that we can do it. The way that I'm going to suggest we do it for this one is a number line. This way, we can visually see 51, and 28. All of these lines in between 51 and 28, are just one extra number. So for example, this is 28. So this would be 2930 3132 3435, so forth, so on all the way to 51. You could just do it with these lines. Or you could you could write the numbers 2830 31. I just did this way to make it easier. What we're going to do now is count the lines in between, or the spaces in between 28 and 51. So what I'm going to do is do this so we're going to say 28 to 29 is 1-234-567-8910 1112 1314 1516 1718 1920 2122 23. So there are 23 spaces in between 28 and 51. That means that the difference between 28 years old and 51 years old, is dying\n",
      "Group A: Okay, today we're gonna be doing a word problem with a table and I'm going to read it out loud. About how much would it cost to buy mp3 players for all 18 classrooms in your school? Use the table to answer the question. On the table, it says that a CD player $74, an mp3 player is $98. A smart speaker is $199. And then am FM radio is $29. So out of that table, let's think about the information that's important to us. Let's repeat the question about how much would it cost to buy mp3 players for all 18 classrooms in your school. So out of that table, we are only talking about the mp3 player. So the rest of the information on the table isn't important to us, and we shouldn't use it, it's just extra information. Looking at the table, we see that an mp3 player cost $98. So on our paper, we're gonna write 98 for the cost of the mp3 player, and we want to know how much it would cost to buy 18 mp, mp three players, because that's how many classrooms there are in the school. So if you want to buy 18 mp3 players, that means that we have to spend $98.18 times because one mp3 player costs $98. And we won by 18 of that. So if we're gonna buy 90, if we're gonna buy 18 players for $98, that means we have to spend $98.18 times, which means this is a multiplication problem. So we can do 98 times 18. To do this, we can set up the standard algorithm, the standard algorithm that looks like this 98 times 18. To start, you do eight times eight, which is 64. Put down the four and carry over the six. Nine times eight is 72 plus the six, which should be 78. rightful down, add a zero and start from here. Eight times one is eight. Nine times one is nine. And then we're gonna add four plus zero is four, eight plus eight is 16. Carry the one. Nine plus seven is 16 plus one SMT. So in total it will cost $1,764. And the reason we know that we could set up the standard algorithm of multiplication is because we need to spend $98.18 times so that's why we set up the standard multiplication algorithm.\n",
      "Group A: Hello everyone. Today we are going to be doing looking at work problems today. And I'm going to show you how I'm kind of thinking about one before you jump into it. So you can see my thought process. Anything, I'm gonna be taking any questions you might be asking myself, and you are able to then use the same questions when you solve a similar problem. So the problem that we picked today is you and his cousins are sharing a pie. Do you eat four tenths of the pie? His cousin ate some more, they ate nine tenths of the pie together, how much of the project his cousin. So in other grades, we might have used a diagram or represented it in a visual. But first, I'm gonna challenge myself to do it. Without looking at officials. How might we go about this? What do I know about the problem? I know. Diego and his cousin. Chico has for 10. I know they altogether have nine tenths. But I don't know how much pie because an eight. So that's why I'm so picky about that. If I don't know how much because it eight by know how much Jayco is I can take the total nine tenths and I can take how much Diego eight. What am I going to do? I'm going to subtract the fractions plus nine tenths minus four tenths equals. So as we know about fractions, if they have the same denominator, you hit the ground air. So I'm going to tell them the bottom and then we can just simply subtract the numbers on the top Newars. So I can easily do nine minus four is five. So then I get 510 So I know that Jesus cousin 85 pounds of pot\n",
      "Group A: Okay, for this think aloud, we're gonna figure out about how much would it cost to buy Np d player, or 18 classrooms in our school. So we have this table that we are going to follow along with. So the price of electronics we have our CD player is $74. The mp3 player is 98. So we're just, we're just gonna focus on that, we're just gonna focus on the mp3 player. So the mp3 player is $90. So that will be the price of US buying just one, just one. So if just one mp3 player is $90, we need 18 adults. So if we have we can't we can't add it because we're not doing that we're doing multiplication for this one. Because we want to figure out how many times do we need to buy an mp3? How many how many times we need to buy mp3 player? And how much would that cost? So yeah, 18 times nanny dollars, which during the math will be 1764. Because we need to buy this mp3 player for all of our classrooms, which there's 18 So we need to buy 18 times. So that will be $90 Each so each time so the costs of it to buy for all 18 classrooms for being 1764. And we figure this out because when you look at the table, each of these prices are just for one. So we have to make sure that we multiply it to get it to the amount we need. For our 18 classes we're looking for the cost\n",
      "Group A: All right, so today's problem is Diego and his cousin are sharing a pie. Diego eight four tenths of the pie. Is cousin ate some more to they ate nine tenths of the pie together. How much of the pie did his cousin eat? So we're going to try to figure out this word problem together to break down the context. First, you want to think about who's in the problem what's going on. So I know that there's someone named Diego. There's his cousin. And there is a pie. So I've drawn out a pie or Don Diego and a cousin. Moving on to the quality and quantities, I know that the pie was split into tenths. Diego ate four tenths of the pie. His cousin ate a unknown number of the pie. I'm gonna put a question mark an all together the nine tenths of the pie. So I do the pine tenths because they're saying nine tenths was eaten Diego 814. So we can assume that the cousin ate some sort of tenths, some amount of tenths of the pie, so I can put a question mark 10 and under number of tents, so what I can do is shade I'm gonna to shade in 1/10 of the pie. Because I know that wasn't eaten. Okay, there, we're down to the nine tenths of the pie with that shaded part. From there, I know that Diego 8/4 hands. So I'm going to mark in the pie, a little D in four of those tests. So if I know Diego at four pieces, and there was one piece that wasn't eaten, we can assume that these remaining pieces were eaten by the cousin. So 12345 So five pieces were eaten by the cousin or five tests, five pieces of size 1/10\n",
      "Group A: Hi class today we're going to talk about adding and subtracting fractions using a story problem. So this story problem is about baking, who likes to bake, I like to bake. So fractions are used a lot in baking, you'll add a half cup of something, a quarter of a cup of something, a 10th of a cup of something you teaspoon, half a tablespoon. And it all goes together when you're doing conversions and stuff. When you're turning one measurement into another measurement bake, it's, it'll all make sense fractions are very important in baking. So this word problem is all about baking. So the problem is, CeCe is making cookies with white and brown sugar. She put two eighths cup of white sugar in the cookie dough, then she puts in the brown sugar. It doesn't say how much she has seven eighths cup of sugar in all. So with the white sugar and the brown sugar, she has seven eighths cut how much brown sugar is in the recipe. So we've seen the problem, we see an important number two eights, that's the amount of white sugar that we have in the problem. Now we don't know how much brown sugar there isn't a problem. But we know that when she's done oh, this is the this is the two weights here. The cameras gonna be easy. This is the to eight. So this is the amount of white sugar two eighths and then we don't know the brown sugar and we know that the total is seven eighths. So we make sure to write the problem because we know that two eighths plus, we don't know equals seven eighths, two eighths white, two eighths cup white sugar, plus the sum amount of brown sugar makes the seven eighths sugar cup of sugar. So if we want to find the amount of brown sugar, well, I think to myself, well, if I know that the white sugar plus the brown sugar made seven eighths, doesn't that mean that I can take the total amount of sugar and take away the amount of white sugar and finally amount of brown sugar? I think we can I think that's what we do. I think we turn this addition problem into a subtraction problem. So we know we see that because both of these fractions are eights, they have a denominator that is eight, we can just subtract them, we don't need to worry about changing the denominator up. So we can just switch it around. So because we know that the total is seven eighths, we put that first. So we have seven eighths, which is the total, we're taking away the white sugar, which is two eighths, and we don't know what it is. So I know think to myself, Well, seven minus two was seven minus two, it's five. We did that. We've done that a lot. We've done that for a couple years now. So I do that. And then I remember Oh yeah, it's a fraction. So it needs a denominator. What was the denominator? Because all of these are eighths, we can just keep that it's there. seven eighths minus two eighths equals five eighths. So we know and it fits into our problem. So if we take it back from the first thing we did two eighths cup of white sugar, plus five eighths cup of brown sugar will equal seven eighths cup total. And we can relate that back to the beginning. We can fill in that question mark to check our work. We check our work we say hmm, does that make sense? If I plugged in that five eighths, what two eighths plus five eighths equals seven eighths. If it doesn't, you know you need to look back at your original problem and try again. But I look at this one I think to myself, yeah, that works. That fits pretty well that fits pretty well to that spot.\n",
      "Group A: So here we have that Ava's mom is 28 and Ava's grandma is 51. So we want to know the difference between the two. So we will be doing subtraction. So now in order to do that minus 28 you don't have enough here, so you have to borrow from the five and now we have three, two. So the difference is 23 years\n",
      "Group A: All right, today we're going to do a word problem. All right, so I'm gonna read out the problem, and I'm going to talk you through how to go about solving it. So we have CC is making cookies with white and brown sugar, she puts two A's cup of white sugar in the cookie dough. Then she puts in the brown sugar. She has seventh eighth cup of sugars, and all how much brown sugar is in the recipe. Alright, first thing I'm going to do is okay, you're asking me how much brown shoes and the recipe. So I know how much white sugar we have. And I know the total amount of sugar we have, they don't have branches. So first thing I'm going to do, I'm going to write down what I do know. So I know we have to cut white sugar. So write that down. And then I know we have seven white and retro write down my information here. Alright. Now, when you think about this, think about it in terms of holes and parts. So my hole would be the total amount of sugar, I have the white sugar plus the brown sugar, and we know that that is seven eighths cups, right. Alright, so we have seven eighths, we know that this seven eighths, this hole is made up of two parts are white sugar and our brown sugar. So we need to find out what that last part is. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to take my hole, and I'm going to take away the part that I know from it. So I have all my sugar, seven, eight, I don't want to take out the part that I know the white shirt. I'm gonna take out the white sugar from the mix. Alright, so I'm gonna do our whole and then I'm going to subtract or take away the part the white sugar. So we have seven eighths minus two eighths. Math, that gives me five eighths. This is the amount that is left. If we have all of our sugar, we take out the white sugar, then the amount that left is five eighths, that is our brown sugar amount. All right. So to recap what we did, we wrote down our knowns, we knew two eights, seven eighths. And then we figured out what did you need to find out and that was the part we had to find the fracture and then we because we had a hole in a part, we subtracted the part from the hole and that gave us the remainder or the rest of the hole was the fracture\n",
      "Group A: Okay, so our problem is CeCe is making cookies with white and brown sugar, she puts two eighths cup of white sugar in the cookie dough. Then she puts in the brown sugar. She has seven eighths cups of sugar and all how much brown sugar is in the recipe. So for this problem, what we already know, let's think about what we already know. What we already know is how much white sugar is in the cookie dough. Now we're gonna think about what we need to figure out. What we're figuring out is how much brown sugar is in the recipe. Something else that we already know is how much sugar in total is in this recipe. So in the cookies, she says that in total, the whole amount of sugar is seven eighths of a cup. So that's our total or total is seven eighths of a cup. Now if we already know she put two eighths of a cup of white sugar, what we need to figure out is that left over bit, that brings two eighths to a total of seven eighths. I had this little visual here for us. So this rectangle represents one cup. This is one cup of sugar. Each little block is an eighth of a cup, because that's our denominator. The denominator is how many pieces there are. For the total amount of pieces. The denominator is the total amount of pieces, and there are eight pieces total in that one cup. However, our whole is different than how much one cup is because what we're told is that she has seven eighths of cup, she has seven eighths cups of sugar and all. So seven eighths is our new hole. So what I've represented here, I have a little bracket that only goes to seven, because there isn't even this, this is not included, and how much sugar there is total. What we're going to color in currently is what we already know. So what we already know is that they're seven, eight total. What we also already know is that two eights are white sugar. So we have two eights that are white sugar so we can color those. So those are our two A's of white sugar. Now to figure out how many cups of brown sugar there are, we have to see how much is left over to get us to our hole and remember our whole is seven eighths, not a whole cup. But how much sugar there is in total is that seven eighths. So to get the leftover or to figure out how much brown sugar there is we're going to count how many pieces are left to get to that seven eighths. So what I see is we're not going to count those because those are white sugar. To get brown sugar. We're going to say this is 12345. So that's how much brown sugar we have. The amount of pieces of brown sugar we have is five we have five pieces of brown sugar, but what is that denominator again? Right? It's eight. So since the denominator is eight, we have five eighths cups of brown sugar\n",
      "Group A: Okay, so I know we all know that we've been working on addition and subtraction problems. And we've been working towards word problems and word problems can seem pretty scary sometimes. But I think you guys can do it. So today we're going to work on problem together. This problem is Ava's mom is 28 years old, and her grandma is 51 years old. So we need to find out how much older is Akos grandma, than her mom. So we can see our numbers that we have here are 51. In 28, we know grandma is 51, and mom is 28 years old. And we're trying to find out the difference between these two numbers. We've talked before that difference means we're going to subtract. So when I want to know the difference between the grandmas age and my mom's age, that I'm going to subtract the mommy the mom's age, from the grandmother's age. So we know we have 51, and we have 28. And we're looking for the difference. I'm going to write 51 minus 28. Equals, I don't know Yeah, equals or question mark. So 51 minus 28. equals what we're trying to find out, which is how much older it was, Grandma is then her mom. So I think what we're gonna do is we're going to look for our friendly numbers. So this, this is close to 50 Is what I'm noticing. So I'm going to use 50, I'm going to subtract, and this one is kind of close to 25. So I'm gonna make this into a 25. And I know that 50 minus 25 gives me 25. But then I can't forget, I still have one for my 51 Oops, one from my one and three from my 28. So I'm going to add one back to make it 26 Because I just took out the one to make it into 50, then I'm going to subtract three from my 28. And 23 is our number. I hope you can see how I did that. I wanted to make 5150 Because it's a little bit easier to work with when subtracting. So I just took our one out knowing later that I needed to add it back in later in my problem, and I made 2825 in that later, I would have to put the three back in, but I just wanted to work with these easier numbers when I'm subtracting, so then I added my one back and subtracting my three and I got 23 as my final answer. So 51 years old minus 28 years old gives me 23 years old. So to answer a question, how much older is Ava's grandmother than her mom? Ava's grandmother is 23 years older than her mom. This is going to be really helpful. You know, in real life when we're trying to find the difference between two objects so we can find out how much more something is than something else. Age, money, weight, anything like that. So it's very useful in our everyday life. So hope I hope that makes sense.\n",
      "Group A: Okay, class. So we are going to answer the problem together, about how much would it cost to buy mp3 players for all 18 classrooms in your school? And we're going to use the table to answer the question. So the first word that really jumps out to me is about. So that means we're making an estimation, it doesn't need to be correct. So remember, we've been working on our rounding. So yes, and where it's going to be multiplication, right? Because it's, we're just looking at this mp3 player, column or row. And so $90.18 times, but rounded. So the first thing that I did is I thought of friendly numbers or numbers that were easier for me to multiply to change them into. So I changed 98 into 118 to 20. So again, it doesn't need to be the exact answer. What I did first is I took away these the 10 points value and the 100 place value. So let's just keep that in the back of our head, because I know that one times two equals two, right? So I've taken care of these are these two notes, sorry, the one and the two, right, but we still have our other place values. So basically, as we can see, there are two zeros here. So it's the hundreds, it's 100 place value, and this one is the 10s place value, right? So we're going to do 100 times 10 And that gives us 1000. All right, so and then we multiply those together and that gives us 2000 So it's going to be about 2000 mp3 players\n",
      "Group A: Okay, so CeCe is making cookies with white and brown sugar, she puts two eats cups of white sugar in the cookie dough. Then she puts in the brown sugar. She has seven eight cups of sugar in all, how much brown sugar is in the recipe. So we know that she puts two eighths cups of blood sugar in the cookie dough. So we're going to start with two eighths, she adds in some amount of brown sugar to get seven eighths cup of sugar and all. So our addition problem is going to look something like this two eighths plus one equals seven eighths. So to help students figure this out, we are going to make a model we're going to draw a model so we're going to draw a big huge cube and make eight different places in it. So here we have white sugar, there's eight boxes in all we are going to coloring two eighths of those boxes. Therefore we're going to cover two of those boxes in with highlighter so we can see that two eighths of the white sugar was used. Now we know that there are seven eighths of sugar in all so we are going to redraw those eight boxes again. But this time we are going to find seven eighths of those boxes. So here we have eight boxes, we are going to color in seven of them because only seven eighths of sugar is used in all seven boxes. Now we need to find the brown sugar. So we can see that these two are shaded. Now we see that seven is shaded as well for the regular sugar, we can see that the brown sugar is five of those boxes because we want to use seven in total. So if we were to shade in two from the white sugar, then 3412345 To get a seven they would equal so see how that came from. So we did two of the white sugar, five of the brown sugar to get seven eight sugars and all so the total number of brown sugar is five eighths cups of\n",
      "Group A: Good afternoon boys and girls, our task today is to find out how much it would cost to buy mp3 players for 18 classrooms in our school. So if we look at the chart, the price of an mp3 player is $98. So one of the strategies that I chose was to decompose our equation which is 98 times 18. And the reason that it is a multiplication equation is because if we added 98 plus 18, that would give us a price for that wouldn't give us the price for 18 classrooms. Because we're going to times 98 by itself 18 times because we are giving an mp3 player to 18 different classrooms. So what I chose to do was decompose the problem. As you can see, I did 98 times 18. And I decompose this into 90 and eight and 10 and eight. And what I did then was I multiplied the factors. Now a factor is what I just did, I decompose them into factors. So I multiplied the factors, I did 90 times 10 and 90 times eight, then I did eight times 10 and eight times eight. Now I got 90 times 10 equals 900. Because I know that 90 times 10 is just adding a place value. So we add a zero to the end. 90 times eight was a little bit more challenging, but I was able to do mental math and recognize that eight is to less than 10. And if 900 is 90 times 10, then 720 must be 90 times eight because I know that nine times nine times two is 18. So as I said before, I just added the place value and I\n",
      "Group A: Okay, so CeCe is making cookies with white and brown sugar. First, she puts into eight cups of white sugar in the cookie dough. So we're starting with our white sugar, and we're using two eighths of a cup. Then she puts in the brown sugar. She has seven, eight cups of sugar and all how much brown sugar is in the recipe. So we start with two eighths, and all of a sudden, we end with seven eighths, we don't exactly know what comes in between. And that's exactly what we want to figure out. And I know that because they asked us how much brown sugar is in the recipe. But when she puts in the brown sugar, we're not given an amount that she adds. And we know that it's adding because it says that she puts in the brown sugar. Our recipe calls for both white and brown sugar, and we're adding them together in our bowl, right. So what we're missing is that brown sugar that she added to get us from two eight cups of sugar to seven eighths total. So we can figure this out by looking at our ACE if this is our cup cups of sugar, and we've used two eighths of white sugar, in the end, we've used total seven eighths, so I can mark up seven out of these eight boxes at the end, we've used 1234567 out of eight of our cups, seven eighths of a cup. Two of those eights were a white sugar in the beginning. So we want to know of the rest of our a seven eighths that we use. How much of it was brown sugar how much comes after we've added these two ace cups of white sugar, our gray shading underneath. To figure this out, we can count just the boxes that are shaded in red. What was added after our white sugar. So we have 12345. And if we remember each one of these little rectangles represents 1/8. We have eight parts here. We put in to eight cups of white sugar at the beginning. And then we added 12345 eighths to get us to a total of 7/8 cups of sugar and all so how much brown sugar is in the recipe. That would be our five eighths\n",
      "Group A: So here we have a word, or word problem is there were 26 students in the cafeteria, there were 42 students on the playground, how many more students were on the playground in the cafeteria. So the first thing that I like to do when I have a word problem like this is trying to figure out how I reword it just to make sure that I can understand put it in my own words. So I understand that there are two different places, the cafeteria and a playground. There are 26 students that are in the cafeteria, there are 42 students that are in the playground, I'm trying to figure out how many more students are in the playground than in the cafeteria, because I understand that there are more students in the playground than are in the cafeteria. So I'm trying to figure out the difference between these two numbers. So once I make sure that I understood the context, I understand, I can reword the problem, I then want to understand what this problem is asking me to do, what am I being asked to solve for? So it says how many more students were in the playground. So I know that I'm trying to find the difference between the students that are in the playground and the students that are on the cafeteria, I know that 42 Is bigger than 26, I'm going to be trying to find the difference between the two. Now that I understand the context of the problem of what it's asking me, I want to try and make sense of the quantities that are in the problem. So we have two quantities, we have 26 and 42. And I want to make sure you understand what they are. So the quantity 26 represents the students in the cafeteria, the quantity 42 represents the students that are in the program. Now that I have made sense my quantities, I can try and think about how I want to represent them. And you can do this in a number of different ways. I thought of two different ways. And there are others. The first way that I thought of was to use a number line. So I've represented my two different quantities here on a number line. And then I can go about solving from there. Or I can represent my quantities using like a base 10 blocks. So one of these Long's represents 10 ones and then each of these represents a one. Here I just represented the 42 because the next step would be for me to take away the quantity of 26. See, that's sort of how you unpack the word problem make make sense of it. Once you have an idea what your quantities are and how you want to represent them then you can go about solving the problem.\n",
      "Group A: All right class, how's everybody doing today? Wonderful. All right, we're gonna go ahead and get started on our word problem of the day. We've been talking a lot about place value lately, and about combining multiple steps in word problems. And sometimes word problems can get a little tricky when we're doing more than one more than one operation in a problem. So what I want to do today is talk to you a little bit about how we can unpack these word problems so that we can really understand what's happening in the word problem, so we can understand what the problem is asking us to do. And we can strategize how to pull out the information that we need, and what to do with these quantities in there in these numbers, remembering that, you know, we need to be flexible thinkers. And there are many different ways that we can approach mathematical word problems. There are many different ways to solve them. So one strategy that you might have might be different than the strategy that your partner has next to you. All right. So today for that purpose. I'm going to just talk through how I think about this word problem. All right, I'm going to give you a think aloud to see how I'm understanding it, and it might be a little different than how you would understand it. And that's totally fine. The other thing, I want to just remind everyone, and we're going to take a deep breath before we get started. Sometimes with these multi step problems, and rounding and operations, it can be a little overwhelming. So before we get started, let's all go ahead and just take one really big breath in and let it out. I don't know about you, but for me, that really helps my brain to refocus so that I can look at the problem with a clear mind. Okay, let's go ahead and I'm going to read my problem first. Right. Got my problem right here. It says Mrs. Malloy, orders, new supplies for the stem club. About how much will it cost to purchase 14 robots? Use the table below to answer the question. My table just has a little bit your table shows everything. Alright, so your tables up on the screen in front of the classroom. Okay, so I'm looking at this and I'm thinking what is happening here? What's going on in my story? What's what's going on in my problem? Well, Mrs. Malloy, she's ordering some supplies for our club. So she's ordering supplies. And then it's asking me how much right? How much will it cost to purchase robots? Robots. Okay, so we're buying some robots? How many robots? Let me think, okay, so it's telling me right here, I need to purchase 14 robots. So then I'm going to be thinking, Okay, how much do the robots cost? So I'm going to look down, up. Here's my supply list, right? So on my supply list, I've got ring lights. No, I've got coding robots that can be added. I've got stem kits, and I've got document cameras. So I'm gonna go back to where I see robots, right. And for me, I'm going to just put a star next to that, because then I know that's the one that I'm going to look at. And that's the number that I'm going to be looking at. So it tells me the robots. Oh, 189. But I need to get 14 of those. That's a lot. That's a lot of numbers. Okay. Let me read this again. Mrs. Malloy orders new supplies for the stem club. About how much will it cost to purchase 14 robots use the table. Alright. So I've got my robots, and I've got 14, I think what I want to do is round this number up, so it's an easier number to work with. So if I'm rounding 189, I think I'm gonna go up to 200 Rather than going down to 100, because I remember, anything more than 150 should go up. So I'm going to take $200 And I'm thinking, I'm probably going to need to multiply that right. If I need 14. I don't really want to add, although I could, I could also add 214 times or I could do 200 times 14. There are many different ways. I want you to come up with some ideas. Give me a\n",

      "Group B: Okay, hi class. So we are learning about word problems. And word problems can be kind of tricky. They even confused Miss Emily. And so to make sense of them, you sometimes used to talk it through with your friends or your teacher, or your parents or even just talking about to yourself. So in today's word problem, it talks about, it says there are 26 students in the cafeteria, there were 42 students on the playground, how many more students were on the playground than in the cafeteria. So we see that they have two numbers, they have 26, in may have 42. So in a word problem, anytime you see a number, you want to circled it, you want to highlight it, because they're usually pretty important. And it gives us two places. So it says there's a cafeteria, and it says there's a playground, and their students in both. So in the cafeteria, I'll just write cafe, in the cafeteria, there are 26. So sometimes you might even want to draw 26 little dots, if that helps. That can be a lot. And then on the other side, there's a playground. So I'll write play in there are 42. So just by this picture, you can't tell you can't see all the students. But when we talked about our tents, places, we said that four is bigger than two. And it's they're both in the tenths place. So we see that 42 Is bigger than 26. So we know that there's more students, excuse me on the playground than in the cafeteria. And so our problem continues to ask us how many more students were on the playground than in the cafeteria. So we know that there's more students in the playground, we want to know how many more and when we talked about adding and subtracting. It's very similar to that. So we want to know how many more students are in the playground in the cafeteria, which means there's a difference. So that means the cafeteria has less students, and we want to count. So imagine you go, you start at 26. And you count all the way to 42. So we don't have enough fingers to do that. But it can look the same as if we did subtraction. So we did 4642, sorry, minus 26. So that is the same thing as if we said, Okay, we're going to start at 26. And then we're going to count all the way up to 42. And we could do that with our fingers and then just tally mark on our boards every time we reach 10. And so when we do this, so 20 620-728-2930. So we get to 30. We're just going to erase this. So we get to 30 using four in the ones place. And then from 30 We know we can jump all the way up to 40 which is ones 10s place so we're going to write 10 and then 4041 42 and that's two more. So we're going to add these up together. 10 plus four and plus two. Four plus two is six. And then we're gonna bring on the one in the\n",
      "Group B: Okay, so we are going to solve a math problem today. And the problem is the ageless mom is 28 years old, her grandma is 51. How much older is ageless grandma than her mom. Now, those are pretty big numbers. But if we write draw a picture, I think we can solve them. So let's figure out what's really going on here. Ava's mom is 28 years old. So let's write that on our paper. She's 20. Oops. She is 28 years old. And her grandma is 51. Really far away. 51. Awesome. Let's draw a line to connect those. Kind of like number one. Okay, and since they're far away, what am I looking for? What I think we're looking for is to see how much older is Eva's grandma than her mom. So we're starting off with how old Ava's mom is. Let's do jumps of 10 to get to 51. Since if you want is really far away. So let's mix them up. Let's go from 28. We'll do a jump on our number line to get to 30. Are we at 51 yet? No. You have to do another jump 38 to 48. One more jump of 10. So two plus 10. More plus 10. More. Right 51 yet? Not quite. We have a little bit more. If we do 48 to 5148 is that 10 more? It isn't. So we have do a smaller jump 44 950 51 out to jump of three. Three more. We have our 210s our jump of 110 our jump of 210s. That's 20 plus three more 2323 years. That tells us that Ava's grandma is 23 years older than Ava's mom\n",
      "Group B: All right, traders, we are going to do a math problem once an estimation. And the problem we chose is how much would it cost to buy mp3 players for all 18 classrooms in our schools? I'm gonna write that down really quick 18 classrooms. So don't forget. So let's think about what's going on. And what's this problem about? What's it telling us? So telling us the price of electronics, our CD player is $74. Our mp3 player is $98. Our smart speaker is $199. And our am FM radio is $29. So what are we looking for in this problem? What we're looking for, about how much would it cost to buy mp3 players for all 18 classrooms in your school? So now we know that we only need to look for the mp3 player. And our mp3 player costs $98. If we're doing estimation, we can estimate that 98 is really close. We can estimate around up to $100. Current around $98 up to $100. All right. Now, if we have 18 classrooms, we I want you guys to try and solve. Let's see how many are how much would it cost to buy mp3 players for 18 classrooms in our school, if an mp3 player costs about $100 When we estimate\n",
      "Group B: Okay, so for this one, I at first did what I would do to solve it, which would be the bar graph split into 818 size pieces show that we are only going to use seven eighths and shading the two eighths. So we know our white sugar. But then I remember that Lindsey told us that by doing that, we're just giving them the answers because all they have to do is count the remaining five eighths and figure out that that's how much brown sugar is left. So what I did was I use the model that she used, which I know is not the only one to share what the students would need to see, which I showed down here. And it's backwards, but basically it shows the two eighths of white sugar is what we know has already gone in. We don't know how much brown sugar but we know that it filled up seven eighths total. So that allows the students to be able to picture it and to see it. And to understand how much space they're going to need to fill up of a cup while still having the understanding that they get to figure it out themselves. And of course then what we would do is we would take seven eighths and either subtract the two eights or add eights until we got to the seven eighths which allows the students to be\n",
      "Group B: a word problem that is talking about making cookies and using different ingredients for our recipe. So the problem says, CeCe is making cookies with white and brown sugar, she put two eighths cup of white sugar in the cookie dough. Then she puts in the brown sugar. She has seven eighths cup of sugar and all how much brown sugar is in the recipe. So before we begin any part of math and this word problem, I want everyone to visualize what this recipe is looking like while CeCe is making me so let's envision CeCe is making this cookie dough and she's making it in a bowl. And I want you to look down and visualize white and brown sugar in our bowl. So let's now talk about the numbers that we know the things that we know and the problem that we can pull directly from the problem and write down on our paper, we have that she puts two eighths cup of white sugar so we can write down to eight eighths of white sugar. And we know that in total she has seven eighths cup of sugar in that bowl that we are visualizing. So I want everyone to look at those two numbers, we are taking one of the numbers and we have the total number so therefore this is Part Part whole we are missing a part of our problem in order to get to the seven eighths so to make this a little bit easier for everyone I want you guys to think about this as a subtraction problem. I want you to look at the two eights and the seven dates. And I want everyone to take their own time to tell me what number we use to get from seven to to seven eighths total. We started at two eighths. So how did we jump from two eighths to seven eighths\n",
      "Group B: All right, so looking at the problem first, Diego and his cousin are sharing by Diego eight fourths, four tenths of a bias, let's write that down. Then his cousin ate some more, so we don't really know much ate, they ate nine tenths of the pie together, how much of the pie did the cousin eat? Alright, so I first originally think of two ways that we can look at this, you can look at it as a or we can do a algorithm with subtraction, taking the whole minus the part, or we can draw it out and see visual. So we're gonna start with a visual, we can start with our hole, which is nine tenths. So you will cover in we have chart, a rectangle broken into 10 pieces, and now we will color in nine tenths of it. I'm more visual person class. So maybe you are the same. So we have nine tenths of the whole color that him Yeah, we know that Diego ate four tenths of the pie. So maybe we choose a different colored represent. So for four tenths, let's go identify four of the boxes Alright, so now we have four out of the 10 boxes highlighted. And now there is five boxes still highlighted out of the total. And that will represent how much that the cousin ate, which is the cousin ate five tenths, which if we simplified it, it would be one half. We could also look at it in this type of shape. Or we can solve it as an algorithm, which would be nine tenths minus four tenths equals and because they have the same denominator, we would just subtract across the top, which nine minus four is five, and we get five tenths again, which can become one half. So either way is great to solve, and it's up to you\n",
      "Group B: Okay, so class we're going to be doing a share think aloud. And so, we're going to be doing this so y'all can make sense of word problems. So the example word a problem that I have here, is Ava's mom is 28 years old, and her grandma is 51. How much older is Ava's grandma and her mom. So Ava's? So Ava's mom 28, and her grandma, is 51. So we're looking for the difference here. When you're trying to find a number that's in between two numbers. That's when I'm finding the difference that's subtraction. So, we take the bigger number 51, and we subtract it from the smaller number 28. We got our problem right here. So you can't subtract a lesson from an eight. So we need to regroup. So I'm going to cross out the five, make it a four in the 51 and then add a zero to make it 10. So 10 minus eight that we can do. 10 minus eight is two. We know that because this is a one to 10. And then next since we made the five of four since we've regrouped it's going to be four minus two, which is two. So the answer is 22. We also want to write the full sentence so 22 What 22 years old. But if you want to go even farther, you can say Ava's grandma is 22 years older than\n",
      "Group B: Okay, so we see that Diego and his cousin are carrying a pack. We see that Diego a 410 Senpai, and his cousin April, the eighth nine tennis together. So we can model this, maybe by drawing it out if we'd like. That's how I'll do it. So we know we have nine tenths of the entire housing together. So we're gonna draw a pie 10 fractions, my drawing is pretty rough. But ideally, these would be 10 equal sections. So definitely not equal. But ideally, they're equal. And we know that the eight, nine tents together, so it might take another color and color in nine of our tents. So each will equal out to 110. So we know Diego eight, four tenths, so maybe one mark or pins, a D, and each one for that to you. And we know he ate four tents. And there was a nine Tenzin in total, we know Diego eight for them. So we might mark that there's a great balance like so. And then we can use our drawing to see that there are 12345 of our colored sections left, and our entire pie because out of 10. So we know do those cars in five tenths are where we can simplify that to one half of the pie. Except we can also think of it as just a normal problem using our adding and subtraction fraction rules that we've already learned. So if we want to instead of drawing a picture, we can just do we can take our 910 that we know of already binning and subtract four tenths from those. So we know nine tenths have already been. And then we know Diego eight for 10. So then we'll have the leftover be his cousin. So we can do nine tenths minus four tenths sign up for a problem like this. And then as we learned, our common denominators allows us to subtract that so we know we can have a 10 at the bottom and our denominators. And then for numerators, we'll do nine minus four is five\n",
      "Group B: Hello students. Today we're gonna be working on word problems. And a word problem is that CeCe is making cookies with white and brown sugar. She puts two eighths cup of white sugar in cookie dough. Then she puts in the brown sugar. She has seven eighths cup of sugar and all how much brown sugar is in the recipe. File. I started this out with drawing. This is supposed to represent the eights cup and I drew eight squares here to represent them. I figured having them drawn separately would make it easier. So we know that she puts in two weeks couple of white sugar in the cookie dough so put a little W down there say that these two reps are gonna white sugar. Vinci puts in the brown sugar but we don't know how much brown sugar she put in there. But it does say that she has seven eighths cup of sugar total. So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to color in seven of my cups to show the total amount of sugar she has in her recipe so we know that this is all the sugar she used. And this is how much we know of it is white sugar. So by this diagram we can tell that these five must be brown sugar because these are what's left of the total amount of brown or all sugar she used. So she uses we know that this is two eighths the white sugar says 123455 eighths. And we know that the total is seven eighths. That's what she used. It's all the sugar she used in the recipe. So we can say that the amount of brown sugar that CeCe used to make her recipe is five eighths cup\n",

And we know that it was a grandma is older than her mom, or trying to figure out how much older her markets so I would think about it is we're trying to get the amount of years in between a grandma and April's mom in order to figure out how much older so there's many different ways you can think about that.

So what we're trying to figure out here is how much older is a post grandma than her mom. So we know that her grandma is older than her mom. And we're trying to figure out how much older she is than her mom. So we're gonna look at the space between her grandma and her mom's page. So if we're looking at this, we might want to see a graph for her mom is 28 and her grammar is 51 and we want to find the space between here. So what are some ways that we can pair that\n",

We're going to skip count each five and label them. 12345123412345234123 And then we have five times four. Five times four is 23. More is 23. So the age difference between people and the grammar is 23. And we did that by using a number line to skip count by fives to gauge the difference\n",
      "Group B: All right, I'm recording so basically we would take a number line because they're asking how much bigger or older Ava's grandma is and her mom, and because Ava's grandma has a larger number, we need to find the difference.

We know that we have mp3 players, we don't need to look at anything else because that's all we're doing is looking at mp3 players. And then we know we're looking for 18 classrooms let me think here, I saw a key word in the problem. Does anyone know what that key word is? About? Correct. So we're looking about how much and mp3 players cost? About how much do you guys correct $100. And I'm looking for that for 18 classrooms. So I want you guys to draw a picture of 18 classrooms and figure out about how much that's going to cost it all.\n",
      "Group B: Hey guys, today we're going to work on a word problem. But what I want to say first is sometimes where problems can give you a whole lot more information than what we need to know. So although it has a lot of information, don't be scared because it's, we're not going to use all of it. Okay, so the word problem says Miss Malloy orders new supplies for the stem club, or the How much will it cost to purchase 14 coding robots. Okay, so now we have what we're looking for, we're going to scroll down to coding robots. And we're gonna write down the price, which is $189. So, if we have $100, and we want to round, or we want to multiply it by 14, because that's how many, we want to find out how how much it cost. If we use that many, so we're gonna multiply. So nine times four is 36. Carry the three. Eight times four is 3233 34353534, times one equals four by six. So and then we're done with a four. We're going to bring up we're going to put in put in a zero as our placeholder, and we have one times nine is nine. Yep, one times eight, which is eight. One times one, which is one, and don't forget to cross off these otherwise, we'll end up using it twice. So we have to add those. We have six plus 069 plus five is 14. Eight plus seven is 15. Plus one is 1616. Carry the one $2,646. But remember, because it's money, don't forget to add your sense. So if Miss Malloy was to buy 14, coding robots at 189 Then her total word count two\n",
      "Group B: So this question is asking us about how much would it cost to buy mp3 players? For all 18 classrooms in your school? And then we're using the table provided to answer the questions. So the table provided is labeled the price of electronics. And it tells us how much a CD player mp3 player, smart speaker and am slash FM radio is. So we're only going to be using the data for the mp3 player because that's all that this problem is asking us about. So on the table, it says that the mp3 player is $98. So we're gonna go ahead and write that down. Because that's one of the facts that we know is true about this problem. And then it's asking how much would it cost to buy mp3 players for all 18 classrooms in your school, so we need to take that $98 and multiply it by 18 to account for all 18 classrooms in the school that we'll be buying the mp3 player for. So then you're gonna go ahead and solve out 98 times eight team, and your final answer is going to be 1764. So the answer to this problem would be that it would cost $1,764 to buy mp3 players for all 18 classrooms in the school.\n",
      "Group B: All right, so our question is CeCe is making cookies with white and brown sugar, she puts two eighths a cup of white sugar in the cookie dough. Then she puts in the brown sugar. She has seven eighths cups of sugar and all how much brown sugar isn't the recipe. So what we can take from our question here is that CeCe is making cookies. And I bet they will be delicious. I would love a cookie right now. And inside of the cookies, there are two different types of sugar, there is white sugar, and there was brown sugar. And there's she puts a little bit of white sugar into her cookie dough. And then next she's going to put in the brown sugar. And we don't quite know how much brown sugar she puts in. But we know that at the end, there are seven eight cups of sugar at all. So she started off with just a little bit and at the ending, she's got a significantly larger amount of sugar. So what we have done here, and what we're looking for is our answer, which is how much brown sugar is in the recipe, we know about the white sugar, we know how much we have in total, we want to know how much brown sugar she's going to put in. So what we can start by doing is start off with a visual with a picture. And our picture for right now is going to be a bowl, it's a cookie bowl. And this is where we're going to be putting our sugar in. So we know that in total there are seven eighths of a cup of sugar in all of our cookies. We know that seven eighths is how much sugar is going to be there. So we have 718 size cups, which is the same as seven eighths of one cup. We also see that on the side we've got brown sugar, and then I can't see and then white sugar right here. So we know what's filling what we already know into our diagram, we know that she has two eighths of a cup of white sugar. two eighths of a cup can also be written as 218 size cups, which is what we know we have here. So we're going to color in one and to have our cups in our bowl. And we know that these are two one eighths. So we also know that we have seven eighths cups of sugar and all these seven eighths cups of sugar, we have two of them are white sugar. And we have how many leftover for brown sugar, we've got 12345 cups left over for brown sugar. So our brown sugar that's in our bowl is going to be the remaining left because we know we only have two types. And we've already filled in all of our white sugar. So we're going to put our brown sugar and all of our cups left. And we know that we have five cups left over. And those five cups. Each of those cups is one eight of a total cup. So we have 518 or 518 the size cups left over which can also be written as five eighths of one cup. So we've got 12345 cups of brown one eight size cups of brown sugar, and we've got 1218 size cups of white sugar. And we know that two and five together make seven and we know that these are all representative of 1/8 size cups. So we know that if out of all seven eights if the 218 size cups are white, then we have 518 size cups of brown sugar and our cookies. We also know that five cups sizes that are one eight is the same as one cup of five eighths. So in total we have five eighths of a cup of brown sugar. In all of our cookies we have five eighths of a cup of brown sugar in all of our cookies.\n",

Okay, so we'll definitely know is the cup white sugar white sugar. This represents white sugar in the cookies. We know that she has seven, eight cup of sugar and what does it not tell us? It doesn't how much brown sugar. So we have a space here where we don't know how much sugar there is. This is what we're trying to figure out. What we do know is that we have seven eighths of seven eighths cup of sugar in total in the recipe. So this is going to represent seven eighths of sugar total. This equals white and brown sugar. So what we're trying to figure out is this here, how could we figure this out? With this on your own and we'll come\n",

So to find the distance we can either subtract, or we can add up to so if we put both grandma's her age, her mom's age and her grandma's age and a number line, we can do a little jumps and figure out what the distance between us is\n",
      "Group B: Problem says CZ is making cookies with white and brown sugar. She puts two aids, a cup of white sugar and the cookie dough. Then she puts in the brown sugar. She has seven eighths of a cup of sugar in awe how much of brown sugar is the rest? So what do we know? We know that we are making good use, okay? We know that there is seven eighths of a cup of sugar, and that's brown sugar and white sugar. And we know that there are two eighths of white sugar in there. So we're trying to figure out how much of the seven eight is brown sugar. And so we would have we could use visual and draw a rectangle or whichever one you would want to do. You would have seven eighths total and it's not a full cup. So you still have some left. Then you have two eighths and you're trying to figure out what is left between what's empty in seven eight to eight\n",
      "Group B: Hello, class. So today we're using estimation skills to estimate a total, or estimate the answer to this word problem. We're not finding the exact answer, but we're just doing some estimations. So here we have a table. If you look at your problem, it shows prices of electronics that are available for our school to buy. So say we have 18 classrooms in our school. And we want to buy mp3 players for all 18 classrooms. So an mp3 player cost $98. What number do you think we could round 98? Two, that's easy. Be 100 I think with estimations, it's good to try and find a number that has zero or five to something you're comfortable rounding to that you're comfortable using in multiplication and addition problems. So if 98 is how much an mp3 player costs, I think we probably round that up to 100. Because in the grand scheme of things, a couple dollars isn't going to mean as much if it's an estimation, obviously we want to precise numbers, we would actually do the math for it. So an mp3 players $100 come around to it in their 18 classrooms. Can you tell me what 100 times 18 is? Can we think of maybe 18 groups of 100. The good thing about 100 is that since it's 100 it's kind of like tents. The numbers correspond to each other. So if there's 18 classrooms, we have 100 of them that means 118 times. So you could basically say 1800\n",
      "Group B: Alright, so for this problem, I'm going to model my thinking to you. So you can learn some good strategies to help you solve this word problem and help you make sense of these mathematical relationships. Okay, so the problem states that Diego and his cousin are sharing a pie, do you go ate four tenths of the pie, and his cousin ate some more. So right away, I know that Diego ate four tenths. And that's some pretty important information. So I'm going to circle that underline it or highlight it, just so I know that this is something I need to solve the problem. And then his cousin ate some more. And that's important too, because I need to know that his cousin ate some more of the pizza. So more slices of the, or the pie were eaten. And then they ate nine tenths of the pie together. So that's the amount that was gone after they both ate. But we don't know how much his cousin ate. So we need to figure out how much pie his cousin ate. So if I set this up in a word problem, first, I know that Diego ate four tenths, and then his cousin ate some more. So we don't know what that number is. And then the total, they the total amount they ate was nine tenths. So I'm gonna set this up like a little equation. So I know that four tenths was eaten, that's Diego, and then another amount was eaten. And I don't know that, and then the total that they ate was nine tenths. So if I set this up for using a diagram, I would use this rectangular diagram, pretend it, it's a, it's a pipe, it's a rectangle. And then I split it up into tenths, and then I shaded in what? Diego eight. So if I shade in the same diagram, to give me a total of nine tenths, I was I would add a few more. So I'm going to add a few more to get me to nine tenths. Because I know that from there to there. This may be a little confusing, but what I first did is I drew this rectangle, and I split it up into tents. And then I shaded in what Diego ate. So I knew that was four tenths right here. And then I knew that the amount that they ate in total was nine tenths, so I shaded in the rest so that the total was nine tenths. And I shaded in with a different color, so I can easily tell what his how much his cousin ate. And so you can see here, if I add these up 12345, his cousin actually ate five tenths of the total pie, but you can also do this. So I just did this with direct modeling. So that's an easy way to do it, but I can also do it through solving the equation. So if I need to figure this out, I want to figure out the difference between nine tenths and four tenths, so nine tenths minus four tenths. So the denominator is going to be\n",
      "Group B: Okay, so prove nothing to this problem. The problem we have is about how much would it cost to buy an mp3 player for all 18 classrooms in your school? So we're going to use the table that gave us to answer the questions at it says about, so we don't have to get an exact answer. So let's see, it gives us the price of a CD player is $74. Do we need to know that? I don't think so. The smart the price of an mp3 player is $98. Well, that's what we're looking for. This price of a smart speaker is $199. But our pushing doesn't ask about a smart speaker. And then the price of an am FM radio is $29. But again, our problem doesn't ask about this. So our problem again says about how much would it cost to buy mp3 players for all 18 classrooms in your school. So we need to take the price of an mp3 player and either add it together at times or multiply it by 18. To figure out our total, but we don't want to multiply 98 by 18, because that's a little bit difficult. So what else can we do to estimate or get about how much it would cost again, it doesn't have to be an exact number. So we could take the 98 and round it to our nearest friendly number that we like which would be 100. And so we could just round the mp3 player price to be about $100. Now if we did this and we bought $100 mp3 player for 18 classrooms, then we have 118 times. So if you multiply 18 by 100 All you have to do is have 18 and add the two zeros so our total price\n",
      "Group B: So about how much would it cost to buy mp3 players for all 18 classrooms in your school? Use the table to answer the question. So there's a lot of unnecessary information in this problem the only in the table the only number you'll need is the 98 which is the mp3 player which is what the question is taught is a multiplication problem. So you have 18 classrooms and then NPV is $98. mp3 player, so it would be two and then you would do\n",
      "Group B: So making sense of this word problem, Diego and his cousin are sharing a pie. Diego ate four tenths of a pie. His cousin ate some more, they ate nine tenths of the pie together, how much of the pie did his cousin eat? So I think first, what I would have my students do is draw out a circle to represent their pie. And go ahead and separate it into 10 pieces. Okay, I take that back, I would think I would actually have them draw out a square or a rectangle, because it's kind of hard to make 10 sections in a circle. So I think just doing a rectangle would be a little bit easier for them. So if something like this or have them draw like that, I would have them go ahead. Well, I would make sure they understand that we're sectioning off into 10 pieces because we have 10 in our denominator and that's the amount of the whole pie. So then I would have them go and color and four of the 10 pieces to show that Diego already ate four of the 10 pieces. And then from there, I would have them with a different color I would have them draw in until they have nine total pieces. So then I would have them go ahead I'd have them draw until they have nine total pieces. So shall they be one piece that's not colored in so something like this and then I would have them count how many pieces they colored with their different color. So we counted 12345 pieces so that means that his cousin ate five of the 10 pieces and that will get them the amount that is because of eight so they can also check their work by taking the answer that they got and then adding it to Diego's to make sure that they got the answer of nine tenths of the pile\n",
